<p>The letters in this story are real letters. I know this
because they were written to me by the man the world
knows as O. Henry, author, and only as the author.
Not half a dozen people knew the real Sydney Porter,
and the man was greater than the author.</p>

<p>There are other letters which are mine own, and no
other eyes shall see them. But the letters in this book
were not written to me as a woman, but rather to the
little girl of his memory who lived next door to him in
the street of Yesterday.</p>

<p>The background for the letters is pure fiction. Maybe
I have let more of myself creep into this tale than I
had planned. If this be true, the reason is that my
whole thought centred upon revealing Sydney Porter
to the lovers of O. HENRY.</p>

<p>I think from the day Dicky left us I have been waiting
with bated breath for this letter. Ghost of our great,
great, great-grandfather who lies in the old cemetery
at Lexington, Virginia! Dicky has been answering a
“Personal” in the New York <cite>Herald</cite>.</p>

<p>“Of course you won’t understand, Caroline,” she
writes me. “There never was a day in your life when
you would have understood. Books are people to you.
You live placidly in that dull little mountain town, and
when your time comes you’ll die there placidly. Had
you been Eve the angel with the flaming sword would
never have had the unpleasant duty of driving you out.
You to tempt a man! You’re like that coldly beautiful
statue Pygmalion fashioned. She waked to life, but
you never will. I wonder why I tell you, Caroline.
The probationers in this hospital—probably in all big
city hospitals—are made to feel like the dirt under foot—if
there was under foot any good honest earth-dirt.
Every time her betters pass her she’s got to paste herself
against the wall, and all the inmates of the hospital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
are her betters. There are some nice young doctors—but
it is against discipline for her to speak to them.
If she does the older nurses punish her with extra work.
Last night, after a hard day, I walked on the Avenue—we
are just a block away—and one of the beautiful
doors opened just like enchantment, thrown back by a
liveried servant. An old, old man came out. Perhaps
it would have been different if youth and beauty
had floated out. All that was his seemed so wasted.
It was just the youth in me, I suppose, that was so
fierce at life and its injustices. The lights down the
Avenue beckoned and beckoned. I wanted to follow
them. The distance was swallowing the old man in his
car. Just for once in my life I wanted a taste of the
city at night; I wanted to forget the groans of the sick
and dying. You’ve never been a prune, and a potato,
and a slice of bread. Try it, Caroline. I, who used to
be Henrietta Dickenson, am now one thousand four
hundred prunes. I am one thousand and ninety-five
potatoes. I spare you the slices of bread. If you
think I exaggerate make the count yourself. Prunes
four times a week—five of them to a saucer. Potatoes
each meal—meals three per day. Potatoes, prunes,
and bread—plain, common food—maybe that’s why
I have done such a common thing.</p>

<p>“I turned off the Avenue. At a news stand I picked
up the <cite>Herald</cite>. ‘You don’t want that. You want an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
evening paper,’ the boy said. Fate or the boy, I know
not which, I took the <cite>Herald</cite>. The ‘ad’ I answered
says the man is lonely; that he wants an attractive
woman friend. The ‘ad’ was signed Telemachus.
His letter fairly scintillated. I answered. He wrote
again. Now he asks for a meeting. But the
letter is oh, so chivalrous, so witty, so wonderful,
Caroline. And there’s a reticence, an impersonal note
in it that piques a woman’s fancy, stirs her imagination——</p>

<p>“I am leaving the hospital now. It is dusk—the time
to meet the hero of one’s adventure. The place of
meeting is not far away. It is only a few blocks down
Madison from the hospital. I have stolen out in a
gypsy dress that I wore at the hospital dance. I have
thrown a long dark cloak about me. In the twilight
I shall escape—not be snatched up and sent to Bellevue.
Don’t worry, Caroline.”</p>

<p>Don’t worry! Since the day Dicky became our
child (mother’s sister’s only child, a little wailing thing
three days old and orphaned of her own mother) I
have worried. Now my heart clutches with fear as
it clutched the day, now a year past, when Dicky threw
into our quiet midst the bomb of her determination
to go away from us. Nineteen-year-old Dicky alone
in the great city of New York. Our guarded and
treasured lambkin thrown into the mouths of wolves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
A trained nurse! Under discipline! Dicky, the free,
gypsy child of our hearts.</p>

<p>We, poor dear old mammy and I, register Dicky’s
emotions as faithfully as a trusted thermometer. That
Dicky should have to rise with the sun, and, having
risen, have to put her own room in order. That Dicky
must be silent in the presence of her superiors. It sounds
like the court of King James, anyway, and not free America—not
that the court of any king would awe Dicky.</p>

<p>Once, before we came to live in the mountains, when
Dicky was six, we paid a visit to grandmother. Dicky
left a saucer of cottage cheese untasted at her plate.
Next morning at breakfast it was there, at dinner, at
tea. I saw when we went in to tea that the child’s
endurance of the saucer of cheese had been reached,
and my coward teeth chattered in terror—grandmother
had attempted to discipline the child before—the
result being that for three interminable days Dicky
had appeared at meals, brought down in the arms of
grandmother’s old coloured butler, robbed of her clothes
and dressed in a royal defiance and a flannel nightgown.
Dicky lifted the offending cheese daintily. She didn’t
look at me or at grandmother. She spoke to old Benjamin,
and she was as perfectly poised and dignified
as a little duchess. “Take it away, please,” she said;
“it’s spoiled.”</p>

<p>“Her mar’s dead, an’ yore mar’s dead,” mammy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
said one morning as I hurried away to my school teaching;
“if you an’ Mr. John can’t an’ won’t do nothin’
to save the child from ruin, mammy will.”</p>

<p>I came home the day of mammy’s disciplining of
Dicky to find the child digging up the lawn. If we
do live in the heart of the Blue Ridge hills I cling to a
remembered civilization—the front yard is the lawn.
Gypsy curls blowing, gypsy eyes flashing, Dicky with
each tiny upflung spade of dirt was shrieking (she
couldn’t have been more than seven), “Mr. Devil, Mr.
Devil, can you hear? I’m going to keep on digging
till I get close enough and you can hear. I want you
to shovel mammy into your hot fire and burn her up.”</p>

<p>I picked Dicky up that day and kissed the anger out
of her flaming little face, and a few minutes later I
heard her say in the voice that makes us wax in Dicky’s
hands, “I was just a little angry with you, Mammy,
and I asked Mr. Devil to burn you up—but I’m not
mad now, and I hope he won’t.”</p>

<p>Dicky went to New York. We knew that she would.
That’s why John and I, dear faithful old mammy, too,
were so helpless, our hearts contracting in fear.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<span class="p-r05"><i>August 13th.</i></span><br>
<i>Sunday Night.</i>
</p>

<p>Scientists tell us that a change that is slow but complete
takes place in the human body every seven years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
They are wrong about the process. It happens in the
twinkling of an eye—like that change in the far-off
judgment day of which the Bible tells. I know. This
very day it happened to me. This Sabbath morning
I waked a healthy, happy, normal spinster behind
whom lay, except for this anxiety Dicky gives, almost
thirty barren-of-emotion years.</p>

<p>Breakfast was not ready when I came down, so I
rushed up the lane. If we lived more pretentiously
it would be the drive. Beyond lay the white road that
leads up to Marsville and trails round the mountain and
out to a wider life.</p>

<p>The hills that neighbour with the blue ether were
shaking night-caps of trailing mist from their heads.
The mountain world breathed deep of August—proclaimed
it exultantly in its vivid summer green as yet
untouched by change; in its full-eared, ripening corn,
massed on the hills like troops of soldiers. The insect
shrills were August noises as were the lazy little chirps
of the birds that have forgotten their joyous outpourings
of spring. I loved it all—even the crow circling
majestically about the distant hills so far away that
his raucous cry came musically—and all of it contented
me. Quite forgetting my approaching thirtieth birthday
I threw a kiss to that mountain on the skyline that
is so like a camel with a humpy back. There’s always
been a secret understanding between that mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
and me, I suppose it is left over from my young
girlhood, I was only eighteen the first time I saw Camel
Back, that some day he would dump all his treasures
into my lap—treasures from all the lands of the East.
Yesterday I got another editor’s check—Camel Back
has always held me steady under my rejections, hence
the salute. Down through the ages how the world
would have laughed if the Egyptians had made their
Sphinx a man—wise Egyptians. As I threw the kiss
to my mountain the shadow of no man was on my heart,
or had ever been, but I felt the thrill of life’s infinite
mystery and promise—felt it and called it an editor’s
check. At thirty a spinster woman may begin to run
to fat, or she may show tendencies to shrivel, but I
boldly declare, my knowledge dating back some dozen
hours, that her heart is unwrinkled, ridiculously young,
and scanning the horizon for Eastern treasures that the
camels that hang in the skyline are to pour into her
lap.</p>

<p>Back home, breakfast over, as John left the table he
tossed a letter to me. It was Dicky’s letter for which
I have waited a whole week. It is in answer to the
dozen I have sent out to her—like wireless messages
of distress.</p>

<p>In the yard, out beyond the shadow of the big white
pines, drying my hair—the women of Marsville have no
beauty parlour in which to ruin it with dry air—lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
full length in the sun, my head pillowed on a cushion,
pondering Dicky’s letter, reading it over and over, I
was jarred out of my reverie by a poke in the ribs and
the mountaineer’s, “Howdy.” I failed to respond, was
poked in the ribs a second time, sprang up indignantly
and glared into the dirty, smiling landscape that is the
face of old Sallie Singleton. “I thought I knowed that
old back,” her harsh voice said amiably. Old back,
indeed. Unmindful of my lack of cordiality the floodgates
opened and harsh verbal oceans submerged me.
I tried to shut it out, but I could not. “Mis Golightly
hadn’t let the fire go out on her hearth for nigh forty
year, but she went over the mountain to visit her
daughter that had her first baby. In hearing of the
train she took homesick and hiked it back. Savannah
Lou was old-like, as I knowed, and, as I knowed, her
beau died. He was full of debts as a dog is full of fleas,
and the Lord knowed what he was doing when He took
him. She had a picter left stid o’ a man, and she was a
sight happier with the picter then she’d a ben with the
man. When he was courtin’ they’d set and set, and
talk and talk. He never took her nowhere—not even
as far as her nose. She set store by the picter. She’d
had a picter man put whiskers on it. She’d allus knowed
whiskers’d become him, but he was stubborn and
wouldn’t grow ’em. She——”</p>

<p>But I had fled, running for my life—or was it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
save the life of old Sallie that I ran? In the twinkling
of an eye the mysterious change had come. Sallie had
poked in the back, the old back that she knowed, a
contented spinster teacher. A horse whisked about
in the shafts and made to go in a direction contrary to
the one he was travelling might understand the bewilderment
of the woman who fled from Sallie Singleton.
I did not. We are strange creatures, blown
upon by winds from the Invisible. We dwell forever
in a little fenced-about cleared plot of ground that is
our daily life and we are frightened if we but glimpse
beyond the cleared land. I had looked over the fence,
and I had seen a trackless region. In sudden panic
I hated placid spinster teachers content to trudge
their sober path through all the days allotted to them;
in sudden terror age with its hideous potentialities of
loneliness fell upon me. Age and old Sallie grown
gray and dirtier but always with the Puck-like knowledge
of the psychologic moment at which to torture
me with the neighbourhood gossip. Age and John,
dear, good John on one side of the fireplace winter
nights roaring at me the advancement of his rheumatism
and I on the other side roaring back the increasing
feebleness of my digestion.</p>

<p>All day this spectre, this fear of the future, has held
me by the throat. All day I have stumbled along in a
maze of distorted thought—swept from all moorings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
common sense. Now I have come into the night, the
big, silent, star-filled night to ask peace of it. Here
under the giant pines that stand like sentinels to guard
the peace of the old house I sit on the bench. How still
and warm and sweet—a white, white August night,
for the coming moon lights the sky. Above all nights
I have loved these August nights—the clematis dropping
from the upper porch airy and diaphanous as a
bride’s veil, and there in the border, running parallel
with the low, long, rambling, gray, gray old house the
white phlox in masses neighbouring with the August
lilies. Looking at the lilies I catch my breath in pain.
In their faint, sweet breathings they say to me, “We
live but for a day. Take warning. Youth flees, dies
as we die.”</p>

<p>John comes to the hall door and peers out into the
dimness of the shadowy pines. “Honey,” he calls,
“are you out there? Good-night. I’m turning in.”
I call back, “Good-night.”</p>

<p>Big and red the moon that is only a little past full
pushes over the hill. The desire to taste the night, to
drown my tumult in its peace seizes me. Out on the
hilltop, alone face to face with the night, and unafraid,
I am indeed swept from my moorings. There to the
east, where the skyline is so sharply irregular, just where
Camel Back marches eternally on the horizon, he makes
me think of a city I have never seen. I want to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
his back as a stepping stone to the moon and look down
on a play I have just been reading about. When the
curtain lifts I want to see those real camels marching
past, their background a sunrise in the desert.</p>

<p>The mountains I love, my beautiful, misty mountains,
are a giant wall of earth to-night. I want to get
over the wall. I want to sit in that theatre, and after
the play I want to be swept along in the street with the
surging crowd and go into a gorgeous, glittery place
and eat delicious things I have never tasted, wearing
the sort of dress I have never seen. I want to live.
If but for one hour of life I want my youth. I could be
part of that pulsing, beating life, part of that splendid
friction—man’s mind stimulating man’s mind.</p>

<p>Back in my room, ready for bed, the light blown out,
sitting at the window, I acknowledge to myself that
the cause of all the day’s emotional upheaval has been
Dicky’s letter. Dicky’s letter that reads:</p>

<p>“In my brave attire I went to meet the hero of my
‘Personal.’ He got cold feet, Caroline. He did not
come. He sent a messenger boy. I had written my
foolish heart out to him. I had told him the things I
tell you. Yes, I know it is reckless to write like that
to a man one never saw. Try being a prune and a potato
and a slice of bread, though, before you condemn
me.</p>

<p>“His letter is the dearest ever, Caroline. I have read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
it over and over. ‘Little gypsy child of nineteen, will
you be just a little disappointed that the messenger
boy is there and not I? Will you believe that I am
going against my desire when I stay away? It isn’t
fair to you that I meet you. It is not fair to the nice
little girl homesick for her southland who has never as
yet spoken to a man to whom she has not been introduced.
The “ad” was just a wager between a man
and me. My name will mean nothing to you, but I
sign it.’</p>

<p>“The name was Robert Haralson, Caroline. And
who can say why things happen as they do? Who can
really tell why that door flung open on the Avenue to
let an old man out should have stirred me to such
rebellion that I who have been well raised by you
and dear old mammy should have done such a madcap
thing. The name did mean something to me—it brought
vague memories—where had I known a Robert Haralson?
And—queer world that it is—I got back to my
room to find the answer to my question on the table.
Mary Tate answered it. When you and good old John
squeezed all the money you could out of the thin acres
of land that we call home and sent me to school I met
Mary. Perhaps you remember. But she was not a
special chum. Soon she is coming on to New York for
her first visit. She has just left Roseboro and there
everybody is talking about Robert Haralson, known at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
home still as Bobby. Everybody is saying that he
was the cleverest and the most popular lad that the
town ever raised. A brilliant future was prophesied
for him, but he got a wanderlust and went trailing off to
the ends of the earth. Roseboro has just discovered
that America’s most brilliant writer and playwright, to
quote the papers, is none other than the man who as a
little lad spilled the family wash—not the clean wash—in
front of the Methodist Church as the congregation
filed out from a revival service, and almost died of shyness.
Roseboro, of course, is shaking congratulatory
hands with itself that its prophecy has come true.
Everywhere you go they talk of Bobby. Now he
seems permanently to have settled in New York and
to have found himself. Mary asks me if I have read,
‘Heart of the World.’ It came out anonymously, as
did no end of brilliant stories. But as a playwright he
can no longer hide behind his anonymity. Mary is
coming to New York soon. She wants to meet him.
She begs for my assistance. Her letter closes like this:
‘It can be done, Dicky. Gossip says further that shy
Bobby Haralson loved one girl like mad. That girl was
Caroline Howard.’</p>

<p>“Dear Caroline, I’ve fallen in love with Bobby’s fascinating
letters. I’ve fallen in love with his chivalrous
protection of me, with his, ‘Little gypsy girl of nineteen.’
Right this minute his card, name, and address<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
lie on my table—and I am lonesomer than I was before
I answered the ‘ad’ but—I won’t do what it is in my
mind to do. It is your Bobby Haralson.”</p>

<p>The clipping Dicky sent says that Mr. Haralson, who is
just <a id="tn_16">beginning</a> to be known as Mr. Haralson, is at present
one of the most interesting men in American literature.
That he has achieved distinction both in fiction and in
drama. That it is difficult to say in which he holds the
more prominent position, that when so many writers
seem to have written themselves out, he never seems
to write up to the full extent of his powers, that always
there is that sense of power held in reserve.</p>

<p>Dicky sent a clipping from a Roseboro newspaper
that tells the story of Bobby’s heroism on shipboard
coming from one of the lands of the Far East. I remember
that story. It was some years ago. In mid-sea the
engines broke down, the boat sprung a leak, and the
men were forced to bail the water from the boat. No
ship came near, and one night a frightful storm swept
the sea. With the boat at the mercy of the waves the
firemen deserted the boilers. It was then that the
blood of Bobby’s ancestors spoke in him; Old Governor
Haralson, Bobby’s grandfather, was a leader of men,
could sway them. And father told me that Bobby’s
young father in a charge at the battle of Shilo was a
figure he never forgot. He said the young Colonel as
he swept into battle at the head of his men wore a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
beautiful, uplifted, unearthly sort of expression and
that he, my father, had often heard him say he had
never felt the sensation of fear on a battlefield. So I
know just how Bobby Haralson loomed above the discouraged
men that night, just how steady his voice
was when he told them that the firemen had deserted
their posts saying it was death to go down into the
hold, but that he was going, and if they were men they
would follow him. Wet and naked and blistered in the
water that was waist-deep in the ship’s hold, death
within and death without, with no hope of saving the
ship, with no help possible had help been near, struggling
to hold their places along the rope line they hauled
the buckets of water up, gaining perceptibly then losing
again, but sending a song up whether there was
the gain of an inch of water or that much loss—a
song that rose above the roar of the sea, hungry for
what surely seemed its prey, and the hiss of the great
boilers.</p>

<p>When we left Roseboro I was fourteen. Bobby
must have been eighteen. A fence divided his house
from ours. There was a side gate, for the families
were intimate, but, mostly, he leaped it. Do I remember
Bobby? I have not thought of him in years,
but to-night some little door of the brain long closed
opens and out of it comes my almost forgotten boy
friend Bobby, like a ghost. Why, just that minute I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
saw his little flashing smile. It came right through
the moonlit window as a friendly hand reaches out to
one on the street of a strange city.</p>

<p>It must be very late, but how wide awake I am.
And how sweet the tuberoses there in the border under
my window are. They seem to float in still pools of
moonlight. As they pour their heavy fragrance over
me the fancy comes, born of the silver, moon-flooded
night, I suppose, that they are trying to tell me something.</p>

<p>Maybe they are. The tuberose has a personality,
strong friends and stout enemies, like some people.
There is nothing negative about it. The fancy persists.
Ah, I have it! Another little brain door swings wide.
But it wasn’t a tuberose. Bobby and the big boys,
his friends, have been on a tramp, they are again standing
under my window, they have waked me with the
old familiar whistle. Mother has said I may have the
magnolias Bobby wants to send up at midnight if I
won’t speak to the boys, if the boys won’t speak to me,
and she has let Bobby suspend a cord from my second-story
window. I am fourteen years old again, and
through the half-closed shutters I am tugging desperately
at those magnolias. Suppressed giggles from the
boys, suppressed giggles from me, too, and they ascend
with slow majesty. Inside the window the secret of
their heaviness is revealed. Candy—tons of it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
devil gets every inhabitant of Marsville who dances,
but in spite of the devil I waltz merrily to my bed.</p>

<span class="p-r15"><i>September 24th.</i></span><br>
<span class="p-r05"><i>Sunday.</i></span>
</p>

<p>Yesterday one of those seemingly unimportant happenings
that change the current of a life came to me.
I look up from the garden seat here among my flowers
and my eyes journey from one accustomed sight to
another. The long, low, rambling, gray old house
drowsing in the mellow, low-lying sunshine, beyond it
the path past the honeysuckle arbour that leads straight
to the old-fashioned spring house, the colts in the pasture,
the cattle at the bars—it is all so familiar that I
smile at the words I have written. I am changed, not
my life.</p>

<p>Yesterday I walked up to Marsville, a mile away,
for the mail, as I mostly do Saturday mornings, and
Ellinor Baxter joined me. Ellinor is not a native
Marsvillian either. Back in the dim past she came for
the health of one of her family. Ellinor has always
had musical yearnings, quite a little talent, too. She
is the village musician and music teacher, and this
year she has an assistant. The assistant is fresh from
a bigger life: last winter she studied in Boston, and she
has a friend who is doing wonderful things in Grand
Opera abroad. It makes Ellinor quite tragic. Yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
when we reached the edge of the wood, and the
mountain world lay about us like a vast picture, Ellinor
flung out her arms as if to embrace all the several hundred
peaks in sight and cried out: “Oh, how I hate that
wall of mountains! If we could sweep it away we’d
get a view, Caroline. We’d see what the world is doing.
It’s a prison wall. I can’t escape. It seems that some
hand of iron holds me here. If I had only gone eight
years ago when mother’s death gave me the freedom to
go! Now I haven’t the youth to make a new life for
myself. Why don’t you go? What holds you here?”</p>

<p>“John, dear, good old John, I suppose,” I answered
slowly.</p>

<p>Ellinor Baxter laughed scornfully. “John would be
a less spoiled citizen without you. You are wasting
the best years of your life. Soon you will be thirty.”</p>

<p>“I am thirty. This is my birthday.” I said it defiantly,
because, uttered, it sounded so very, very ancient.</p>

<p>Ellinor suddenly softened. “You look a young
twenty-five. Some women begin to fade at twenty-five.
Some mornings when you rush past to school
you look eighteen——</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>
<p>“Ellinor!”</p>

<p>But Ellinor was in deadly earnest. Her eyes were
full of tears. “Child,” she said, “get away from here.
Love, marry, fulfil your destiny.”</p>

<p>For just a moment I stopped and shut my eyes,
pretending that a brier had caught my skirt. With
shut eyes I knew that deep in the emerald world about
me the black gum flaunted its crimson leaves—emblem
of change; that the corn in long, straight rows
stood hardening in the ear; that the mountains, glistening
chain on glistening chain, were shimmering in
the morning light. Standing there, I saw more:
October’s pageant; November’s dull, soft tones; the
desolation and the grayness that is December mountains’
dim forms seen through curtains of rain; January’s
white, white world—and then the surprise of a snowdrop,
the warm, fragrant spring breath of the south wind
shepherding flocks of snowy clouds.</p>

<p>“I love it all,” I said. And I spoke the truth. Since
that August Sunday now a month past, since that
earthquake upheaval, I have basked in peace. “I am
busy. Most of the year I wake with just the thought
of scrambling into my clothes, swallowing my breakfast,
and getting to the schoolroom in time. When it is winter
it is almost dark when I get home; when it is spring
I have my flowers. And there’s always John’s clothes
to mend and my own to make and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>But with a gesture that was passionate Ellinor Baxter
stopped me. “All this may satisfy at thirty, but it
won’t feed a woman’s heart at forty. Then she feels
the need of love—contact with a man’s broader life.
The monotony, the emptiness of life as she lives it
alone tortures at forty. I know, for I am thirty-eight.
And if she finds this out at forty it is mostly too late.
Men pass us by for fresher faces.”</p>

<p>I did not know this new Ellinor Baxter who had
lifted her mask and given me a peep at the real woman
behind it, but for the first time in my life I loved her.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As we turned into Main Street a big automobile
was leaving the post-office. Mr. Black and his nice
little wife—new people who are summering here—were
in the tonneau. I hardly know how it came about, but
in what seemed the twinkling of an eye Ellinor and I
were in it, too. I did not understand where it was we
were going, and when I tried to find out I swallowed so
many buckets of air that I gave it up. But it was not
of the slightest importance. All that had ever happened
to me was of slight importance. I was having
my first automobile ride. We seemed to winnow the air
like birds: to dip and dart down and around the curves,
to soar up the hills with the flash and swiftness of wings.
A dozen miles from our village we raced up a stately
avenue and ran under a <i lang="fr">porte-cochère</i>—our flight at end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>The lady who came out to greet us was surrounded
by dogs, big and little, aristocratic and plebeian, handsome
and hideous. After greeting her, Mrs. Black
drew me forward and said: “Edna, this is Caroline
Howard, who adores every word you write. Edna is
my sister, Miss Howard.”</p>

<p>I draw a long breath of happiness at thought of yesterday.
I live it all over again. I feel sure it was no
ordinary spark of liking that leaped between Edna Kennedy
and me instantaneously and spontaneously. We
had luncheon yesterday on a big wide veranda that
overlooks a winding ribbon of a river from the view we
had of it as calm and still as if frozen. After luncheon
there was music: Geraldine Farrar in “Madam Butterfly”—and
the story unfolded before me. I felt
the anguish of that poor little waiting and trusting and
praying wife. Tetrazzini in the mad scene from “Lucia,”
and the flutelike voice going high and high and
higher, till I bent forward in breathless suspense to
drop back in my chair in content at that last marvellously
dizzyingly high sweet bird note. Moved by a
little burst of confidence I could not control, I told Edna
Kennedy that I had never heard grand opera; that I
had never been anywhere or seen anything. And then
I told her of the thrilly little waves running up and down
me that were fairly shouting it was the beginning and
not the end of beautiful happenings to me—just as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
though I had walked through a wood and come to a
beautiful palace, and only stepped up on the portico
with my hand still on the doorknob. I told her about
Robert Haralson, too: what friends we were when I was
little, before we came to live in the mountains. I was
dreadfully disappointed that she does not know him.
She says few people know him. She says he is shy;
that he lives in his work—that the first night of the big
play that is making him so rich and famous he ran
away from the theatre afraid of the call that authors
get to come before the curtain. As we were leaving,
Edna Kennedy gathered some magazines from the
library table and gave them to me. “He is in them all,”
she said. “Nobody in the literary and dramatic world
is more in the public eye.”</p>

<p>I was very quiet coming home, and everything
seemed little and mean and isolated and countrified
when I got here. I went to my room immediately
after supper. I said I was tired, but I was never less
tired in my life. I read all the things the magazines
said about Robert Haralson, and I looked long at
the picture I found in one of them of my old-time
boy friend. I have not treasured any sentimental memories
of Bobby. I was little more than a child
when I last saw him. It is true that the whole town
teased Bobby about me—they called me his little
sweetheart and accused him of robbing the cradle—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
I have no treasured memories of him or of
any man.</p>

<p>I am indifferent to men, as Dicky says. Always I have
turned with distaste from the thought of marriage. In
that I think I am different from most women. There
have been two—such nice splendid fellows I knew in
my college life—who have penetrated my wilderness
more times than one. And I? I like them. Life
with either would seem to hold much that it withholds
now. I have tried to yield, but I cannot; the thought
of the nearness of what should be sweet and sacred to a
woman brings a wave of physical nausea. For that
reason I don’t in the least understand what came over
me last night as I gazed at a picture only dimly familiar
to me. Ellinor’s words came back throbbing with their
loneliness and hunger. I knew them to be true. I saw
myself at forty rushing through breakfast and running
the mile to school, pottering about the flowers, mending
the clothes—day after day, month after month,
year after year spent in dull monotony—and my
youth rolled away—my life.</p>

<p>I did a strange thing—I, trained to chain my emotions
as we chain wild beasts, in frantic haste I wrote
to Bobby. It was not much of a letter—just:</p>

<p>“Bobby, I wonder if the years have swept from your
brain cells all memory of the little girl who used to
live next door? She’ll never get to New York, never!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
There’s a wall of mountains that she can’t scale. But
if ever you come to Marsville, whistle across the fence,
won’t you? The little girl’s got one of your stories
treasured in her desk without knowing until some one’s
letter gave away the secret of its authorship. Big
congratulations, Bobby!”</p>

<p>I went down to the yard and waked old Harris and
paid him to walk to the railroad station, three miles
across the gap, and mail it. Now it is late Sunday
afternoon and it has been gone almost a whole day.
But of course I will never have an answer to it. I am
sure Mr. Robert Haralson keeps a female secretary who
will scan it coldly and throw it in the waste basket.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Dear “Miss Carrie”</span>:</p>

<p>Just once, if I may—and then I will try to think of
you as Caroline.</p>

<p>I was gladder to get your little note than the biggest
editor’s check I ever saw. Seems to me (after trying
very hard) I do remember a small “sassy” girl that
used to live next door.</p>

<p>When you ask if I remember you, it reminds me of a
story told of Congressman John Allen of Mississipi—(never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
could spell Mississip)—is that right? A lady
approached him in Washington one day and held out
her hand. “Now confess, Mr. Allen,” she said, “that
you’ve forgotten all about me.”</p>

<p>He had; he knew her face, but his memory wouldn’t
serve him any further. But, with a low bow, he replied:
“Madam, I’ve made it the business of my life to
try to forget you.”</p>

<p>See?—as we New Yorkers say.</p>

<p>Well, well, how time does fly! as the little boy said
when his teacher told him Rome was founded in 684
<span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> I never expected anything so nice and jolly as
to hear from you. It’s like finding a five-dollar bill in
an old vest pocket.</p>

<p>Isn’t it funny that I was thinking of you a little while
last week? I had a map, looking all about on it trying
to decide on somewhere to go for a few weeks to get
away from the city. Mountains for me always! So
my eye naturally ran down the Blue Ridge chain.
Here’s the latest picture of the distinguished Mr.
Haralson. Does it look anything like the moonstruck
little shrimp that used to hang around and bother you
so much? I can remember what an awkward, bashful,
sentimental, ugly, uninteresting nuisance I was then.
No wonder I couldn’t make any impression on you!
I’ve improved a good deal since. In fact, it seems to
me that the older I grow the better looking and more
fascinating I become. Of course it doesn’t seem just
right for me to say so, but if I didn’t tell you you
mightn’t ever find it out.</p>

<p>In those days I took life mighty seriously and sentimentally:
that’s why I always went about looking
like a monkey with the toothache; but in after years I
learned that life is only a jolly good comedy for the
most part, and I began to enjoy it. I believe I’m about
five years younger than I was the last time you saw me—when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
you left the depot in Roseboro for Marsville.
Ernest Cold rode up with you on the train; and I
haven’t forgiven him for it yet.</p>

<p>It’s mighty nice of you to say you would be able to
stand seeing me again if I should come to Marsville.
I shore would love to ride up and holler “Hello!” over
the fence. Lemme see! Trip to Europe—automobiles—steam
yacht—Rockefeller’s money—no, none of
those things sound half as good. But lawsy me! I
don’t know when I shall ever drap down your way.</p>

<p>I’ve about decided to go up along the Maine coast
fishing with an editor man. I live in a room or two as big
as a barn on Waverly Place. I’m so lazy and cool and
contented there all by myself with my books and things
that I haven’t been away from town in two summers.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not going to talk about myself any more.
I’ve been in New York about four years, and I guess
I’ve “made good,” for everything I write is engaged
long before it is written.</p>

<p>I’ve been puzzling over your signature. It’s the
same old name you had when you wore your hair in a
plait; and I have two very good reasons for thinking
it ought to be different. One is that somebody wrote
me several years ago that you had married; and the
other is that it isn’t possible—it isn’t <em>possible</em>—that
the young men of our old state could be so unappreciative
as to have let you escape. But if you are married,
please, oh, please get a divorce at once, so you can
be “Miss Carrie” again.</p>

<p>I am trusting to your good nature to accept a little
book of mine that came out last winter. You don’t
have to read it, you know. It’s just the thing to prop
the kitchen door when the wind is in the east.</p>

<p>And, Miss Carrie, some day when you ain’t real busy
won’t you sit at your desk where you keep those antiquated
stories, and write to me? I’d be so pleased to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
hear something about what the years have done for
you, and what you think about when the tree frogs begin
to holler in the evenings. Got any tree frogs up
there?</p>

<p>Do this, and I’ll promise to say “Caroline” next time.</p>

<p>Let me say once more how good it was to hear from
you, and that I am, yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="right">

</p>

<p>The picture and the book have come. The picture
is splendid. It dominates my room.</p>

<p>Bobby <em>was</em> awfully fond of me. Lots of things I had
forgotten come back as I look at the picture—the night
he was allowed by mother after some hours of hard
begging to take me to Commencement at the Female
Seminary in old Roseboro and sat with his arm stretched
on the back of the bench. I did not think it would be nice
of me to ask him to remove it, and my back aches right
now again at thought of the rigidity of my spine through
the long hours of that female evening. You would not
be guilty of such a ruralism now, Mr. Cosmopolite.</p>

<p>I have written him. It is only polite to let him know
that I appreciate the picture and the book.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<span class="p-r1"><i>October 2d.</i></span><br>
<i>Monday Afternoon.</i>
</p>

<p>Bobby’s letter was here this afternoon when I got
in from school. Wasn’t it marvellous that it could get
here? My eyes went straight to the table and I felt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
kind of queer and quivery all over when I saw the big
square envelope with the bold handwriting that looked
as familiar as if I had been getting his letters all my
life. Here is his letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<br>
<p class="p1 right">
<i>New York, September 30th.</i></p>
<br>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Dear Miss Carrie</span>:</p>

<p>Never thought you were going to stir up so much
trouble when you did me that big favour of writing a
“hello” to me across the mountains, did you? Well,
please let me write this time, and if it’s too much, give
me the teeny-weenyest bit of a hint, and I’ll turn my
pen into a sword and cut it all out.</p>

<p>Was it cheeky of you to write to me? My dear Miss
Carrie, I don’t know exactly what the unpardonable
sin is, but if you hadn’t written, I’d feel awfully anxious
about your future.</p>

<p>Right here let me assure you that I’m not one of these
confirmed correspondents. Hand on my heart! I
vow I haven’t written two pages at a time to anybody
in years and years. My closest friends complain that
I don’t even answer letters. But when I hear from—oh,
you forbade that, didn’t you.</p>

<p>Don’t chain up your impulses, dear friend; let ’em
skallyhoot around. We don’t live more than nine
times; and bottles and chains weren’t made for people
to confine and tie up their good impulses with.</p>

<p>So you shook your head when you read that I was
thinking of you last week? All right. Couldn’t
expect you to believe. But please turn to page 78 and
page 131 of the book I sent you, and try to think whose
eyes I attempted to describe. Since I saw you last
I’ve seen only one pair of eyes like that; and they—well,
they only <em>resembled</em>.</p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>

<p>Think I’m foolish? Oh, no, I’m not. One can have
an ideal if one wants to. I’ve had one for—years.
All I’ve had since have busted and gone up the flume.
Please, Miss Carrie, lemme keep that one. I ain’t
going to bother you about it. You say those old days
are laid away between lavender scented sheets. I can
understand that for you. Mine are not. They are
fresh and fragrant, dewy and everlasting. I’m not
going to insist upon your believing it—shake your head
if you want to and give the sun a chance to brighten
his rays. I’m superior to luck, fate, history, and time.
If I choose to stand under a certain window yet in Roseboro
and sigh for the unattainable, no one shall balk
me. So, don’t you try to bulldoze me, Miss Caroline
Howard. If my spirit elects to wander there, please
you let it alone.</p>

<p>Do you know that over there in the Ridge of blue and
gold you are the most splendidly endowed of all the
daughters of the gods? Why? Because my memory
tells me that you have (to my memorial eye and mind)
all that can be conferred of loveliness; and, according to
your boast, you have a new and delectable way of fixing
tomatoes. Now, I adore tomatters. I could die for
’em, I nearly have several times. You can’t imagine
how interested I was in your tomato garden. In your
tomato garden. Say—I believe you promulgated some
nonsense in your letter about whether I stood under
Fifth Avenue girls’ windows about midnight and sent
up flowers and candies. Why, lemme tell you, Miss
Carrie, I’ve seen ’em and talked to ’em, and had tea
with ’em—and lemme tell you—I’d rather set (not sit)
across a little table with you and have a tomatter between
us with ice and——</p>

<p>Say—I don’t agree with you about the nuts. Why, I
never saw a tomatter in my life stuffed with nuts. Air
they good? The ice sounds all right. And lemme tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
you—I think you’re wrong about the Mayonnaise
dressing. I have such a respect for tomatters that I
must challenge you. French dressing, with green
peppers—so say I.</p>

<p>And yet it is no more than Cosmic and Natural Justice
that you should be woozy about the proper way to
fix tomatters. Perfection has never been attained by
mortals. (Now my memory is at work again.) If
you could be as I remember you and an expert in tomatters,
too, why there would be double perfection,
and that’s an unknown quantity in mathematics. I
prefer to retain my ideal; therefore the deduction is:
your tomatters are off their trolley. Still, I’d like to
try one. That’s constancy and faith. Will you keep
one on ice for me, on the chance that good Fortune may
allow me to drift down that way?</p>

<p>I sent up yesterday and got the Christmas <em>Leslies</em>.
Why, I remembered that story, though I didn’t recognize
the name. It was very sweet and tender. I can
see that you like kids. I congratulate you heartily
on your work; I hope you will find it profitable and
a blessing. You have unquestioned sympathy and a
deep and true “humanness.” You ought to come to
New York, where you will be <em>in medias res</em>. There’s
nothing like being on the ground. You get artistic
ideas and associations here that would be invaluable
to you. Writing is a bully game. You want to know
the dealers. I studied that fact out, and came here.
To-day I get five times more per word than when I
came. Sister of the pen and stamped-envelope-for-return,
I speak wisdom to you. And here is life.
Beautiful are the mountains and the moon silvering
their tops; but here one learns the value of each upon
each. And the moonlight of the mind is the most
beautiful. Here art teaches Nature to conform. You
could expand and rise here. I do not advise you, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
I speak with wisdom of the markets and the heart.
Pardon me if I am scornful of the Mayonnaise, and am
dubious about the nuts. I could overlook a stab at
my heart with a poniard, but—the tomatter and I have
been friends. Yet I could—may I try one the way you
fix ’em?</p>

<p>Wish I could have accepted your invitation to sail
down on the big golden bubble of a moon, and drap
under the cherry tree. Bet a dollar I’d have lit on the
rake and the hoe you left there in the grass. Can’t
you ever remember to put ’em behind the door in the
woodhouse when you are scratching around in the garden?
I haven’t ridden on the moon in a long time. It’s
on the full now, and I’m afraid I’d slide off. When it
gets to look like a slice of canteloupe again, so I can
hold on to the ends, I’ll try to make that trip. Please
spread an armful of hay and an old piece of carpet under
the cherry tree so I won’t come down with such a jolt
when I jump off. Then I’d say something like this:</p>

<p>“Miss Howard, please excuse my intrusion into your
section of real estate devoted to domestic agriculture;
but the object of my somewhat precipitous descent is to
ascertain the identity of a certain youthful and pulchritudinous
being with whom at a considerably earlier
period I sustained cognizance, and whose identification
is relatively dependent upon a tonsorial arrangement in
which her tresses retain the perpendicularity peculiar
to juvenility at the time referred to.”</p>

<p>And you would answer:</p>

<p>“Sir, regretting the futility of your rather incomprehensible
errand—which, had you been better versed
in the more recent dictates of fashion, might have been
advantageously and indefinitely postponed—I must inform
you that none of the coiffures that are worn this
summer allow any such primitive and adolescent arrangement
of the capillary filaments as you refer to in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
your preamble; and therefore, as far as the little girl
whose hair was in a plait is concerned, there is nothing
doing.”</p>

<p>I’ll bet that’s what’d happen to me. And then I’d
have to go down to the road and sit on the fence and
wait a month to catch the moon back.</p>

<p>Miss Carrie, please, please send me that picture of
yourself that you mentioned, or another one. If your
heart hadn’t been so hard and cruel you’d have enclosed
it before instead of talking about it. How can
you write those tender and kind little stories when
really you are so unfeeling and stony hearted? You
knew I wanted that picture. I’m going to tell all the
editors I know that your work is a fraud—that you
don’t feel it at all.</p>

<p>No doubt there isn’t a single tear in your eye or the
slightest thawing of your heart when I remind you that
in another two weeks I shall be treading the pathless
wilds of Maine. There in the dense tropical forest an
infuriated porcupine may spring upon me from some
lofty iceberg, or, becoming lost, I might perish in the
snow of sunstroke. Think, Miss Carrie, what an ad
it would be for you when the papers printed the news
of a tourist found in the woods—an unknown man wearing
tennis shoes and a woollen comforter, with 30 cents
in his pocket, a frozen tomato in one hand, and a picture
of the well-known and beautiful authoress C. H. in the
other. It is no less than your duty to your publishers
to try and get that ad. So, please send on the picture,
will you?</p>

<p class="p2">Is it because I live here on the edge of the world,
outside of its activity, that I read Bobby’s letter over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
and over? Is that the reason I search page 78 and page
131 of the book? The eyes of Bobby’s heroine are
beautiful, and he says they are like mine. It was dear
of him to remember the colour of my eyes through all
these years. I couldn’t have told the colour of his
eyes. And I fibbed when I said those old memories
were laid away in lavender scented sheets. That’s
the trouble with a spinster. She can be counted on to
run to sentiment with or without encouragement.</p>

<p>Oh, dear, I’m so tired. I want life different—not
just to go in and eat supper and look over the lessons
for to-morrow and read something and go to bed, as I
have done all the nights of the past twelve Octobers
and am likely to continue for the next several dozen of
them. I fibbed when I wrote Bobby I had memories.
I haven’t. And I don’t want memories—memories
that sigh of age. I want joys that dance with youth.
I want to sit at a little table and look across—not at
John.</p>

<p>When I came home this afternoon there was my letter.
I could have told Bobby that Marsville young
women were hopelessly ancient at twenty-five, that
nobody ever looked at them after they were thirty.
Instead, I told him about the drummer who tried to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
flirt with me on the train. In my effort to get rid of
him I moved all over the coach and finally took the
last seat, to have him take the last seat opposite. I
wrote Bobby that I thought of moving into the Pullman,
but that the trip was short and my economic
soul balked at the suggestion.</p>

<i>Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunset.</i>
</p>

<p>I was up with the day this morning. At sunrise I
had breakfasted and was in the lumbering old hack
bumping over the miles that end with the trolley that
carries us these days into our mountain city and metropolis
twenty miles away from this little town. I went
in to do my fall shopping, hat and coat suit and some
other needed little things. There’s a new woman’s
outfitter that has stimulated shopping marvellously.
I saw some stunning things, and I bought—a white
silk evening gown, very modern, very clinging, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
beautiful. There’s a cunning little fringe of crystal
beads on the short sleeves. The dear little skimpy sash-ends
have the crystal fringe, too. When I moved about
in it and tried it on, the funny little waves of happiness
ran up and down my spine and thrilled my knees just
as if I really had my hand on the doorknob of that
Magic Palace I first divined that day at Edna Kennedy’s.
Something pagan stirred in me with the
tinkle of my barbaric finery. I bought white silk
stockings and white satin slippers, too. I spent every
penny of three months’ hard work, and I borrowed my
fare on the trolley from our butcher. If he had not
been on I suppose I would have asked the conductor
for a loan. The Bible says take no thought of the
morrow. I did not. But to-morrow, when icy winds
blow, with what shall I be clothed? I shan’t worry
now. It is too warm and lovely. If I should spend
my winter in the state asylum, and I do seem headed
that way, my old suit will be quite stylish enough.</p>

<p>There are some La France roses blooming, as lovely
ones as I have ever had. I get up from the garden seat
and catch their pink satin faces to me and bury my face
in their fragrant hearts. I whisper to them: “My poor
foolish darlings, why do you bloom so late? Do you
not know that all this wonderfulness of warmth, this
semblance of summer, is a deception? Do you not
know that winter is at hand? What is this absurd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
thing blooming in my heart as satiny pink and perfumed
as they? The amethyst light has gone from the
hills; gray and quiet they wrap their night robes of mist
about them and wait for the morning. And the sky,
still tender, waits for the stars. And I—for what do
I wait?”</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<span class="p-r1"><i>October 8th.</i></span><br>
<i>Sunday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunset.</i>
</p>

<p>The day has been hot. It has rained somewhere and
there is a superb sunset display. It seems that all the
golds and crimsons and purples in the world have been
pounded and mixed in a vast mortar and flung in one
magnificent wave of colour on the western sky. The
mountains are wine drenched. The garden riots in
colour. Everywhere colour, warmth, perfume. The
glory fades, but the warmth remains. Oh, the moon!
Big as a wagon wheel it wavers on the hill, hesitating
about its plunge into space. I must go in. Mammy
is calling me to supper. Yes, blessed old coloured lady,
I am coming! Her eyes are dim. She could not have
seen that it was my bedroom rug I put under the
cherry tree.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>Midnight.</i>
</p>

<p>Was it I who put the rug under the cherry tree?
Was it I who crept down the stairs in such delicious
stealth? And did it all happen just two hours ago when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
John’s light went out? I had dressed in my tinkling
finery, with my hair done like hers on page 131, and
I went down to see myself full length in the big old
mirror brought from the childhood home. I did not
mean to go outside, but the moonlight lay in silver
splashes on the portico, and as I stepped into it it
swept over me in one great delirious wave, not just
ordinary moonlight—sorcery. Standing there in my
shimmering gown and satin shoes, I lost all sense of the
real me. Drawn by that compelling light that lay on
the world beyond the door in a still white flood, I
stepped into the fragrant night and sped to the big old
cherry tree. No, not I—a red-lipped, shining-eyed,
radiant young creature that bore only a physical resemblance
to me. Not a leaf dropped to fret the stillness.
Nothing stirred, and yet the whole world
seemed afloat. I heard the gate’s click as it opened.
The man’s soft felt hat was pulled down low on his
brow, shading the features, but I knew him—that is, I
divined who it was. Just for a moment I thought him
a vision breathed into the night by its magic and my
desire to have him there. Just for a moment the solid
earth, the misty hills lost foundation. He did not see
me so still in the shadow of the cherry tree. Halfway
up the walk he stopped, perhaps with the realization
that the house was dark, for I had blown out the lamp
I carried down. He stood there very still. When he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
turned he walked rapidly down the walk and out the
gate. I made a swift little rush from under the tree, a
swift little rush that sent out a myriad of tiny sounds—that
pagan thing in me alive, clamouring for its
woman’s birthright. I think the gate’s sharp click
drowned the tinkling call of my finery. He did not
glance back. After what seemed an æon of time I
heard voices—the faint roll of wheels.</p>

<p>Perhaps I would think the whole fantastic thing a
dream were it not for the wicked glitter of the baubles
on my poor little frock that lies in a neglected heap
there in the moonlight where I stepped out of it.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>October 26th.</i>
</p>

<p>Twenty days since I wrote those last words—twenty
warm, still, sun-drenched days as like one to another
as peas in a pod. The oldest inhabitant fails to remember
such another October. But this morning,
without the warning of a frost, it has come. The
sun floods my desolated and blackened garden. It
always hurts me to give up my flower children. I
should hear only the pleasantest things at breakfast
the morning of a freeze, but this morning after John
had gone mammy brought my hot cakes in and told
me that Lucius Blake was the author of a story that
was spreading over the village like fire. Lucius said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
that he had driven the finest sort of a dude down to
our house Sunday night, October 8th. Lucius said
he came inside the gate, stood there like a stone, and
that when he came back to the buggy he said: “I should
have warned my friends of my arrival. I suspect
from the darkened house that they are absent at
Grand Opera.” He then offered Lucius ten dollars
to drive him to town, and they rode through the night
in silence. I should think the silence would have killed
Lucius, but he has lived to tell the tale. I am not in the
least comforted that mammy, on the pretense that we
need sugar, has hurried up to the village to tell everybody
that Lucius is a liar—in the language of the mountains
a master liar. I am not in the least comforted
with anything. Fate, you are a cruel jade to let me
put the light out, and I hate you. I have snatched the
poor innocent-of-offence gown from its hanger, if it
is innocent—I remember that night it twinkled so
wickedly—and I have flung it into the fire. I feel
wildly happy that Bobby’s book smoulders on it.
But I have turned my eyes away as a wicked, yellowish-red,
forked tongued flame leaps at the wavy
lock of hair that always I know escapes Bobby’s
brushes because it likes to lie on his broad, thoughtful
brow.</p>

<p>How odd the room feels without the picture. I’ve
got in the way of looking for the greeting from those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
watchful eyes, in the way of seeing the mocking smile
on those pictured lips, the minute I open my door. No
simple maiden in her charm for you, Mr. Robert Haralson!
Do I see you this minute motoring down your
brilliant Avenue? And do I see her, the pride of your
Avenue? Our uplands do not breed such exotics.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>November 15th.</i>
</p>

<p>The days drift by like dull-hued birds. There’s
not a song in the throat of a single one. Dull-hued
is the word, for the rains have washed the colour from
the hills. And like a giant graystone prison wall the
mountains, desolate, rattlesnaky things, stand against
the sky. Jack the Giant Killer himself couldn’t scale
them. Mammy watches me anxiously. She says I
am sick. I am—sick for a bigger life. Teaching
is routine after twelve years. I haven’t any worry.
Dicky since her “Personal” escapade is being good,
unless some mischief is brewing she has not yet got into
trouble over. Some day—not this dull-eyed day—I
mean to put to myself the question, “Why have you
never said one word to Robert Haralson about Dicky—poor,
cooped-up, lonely little Dicky?” And I mean
to get an honest answer.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp; December 21st.</i>
</p>

<p>The gods on Mount Olympus, if it be they that control
gray, heavy-lidded days like these, had compassion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
on me and let to-day be Friday. I’d have killed all the
children in another day, and now I have until Monday
to get back to something akin to normal. I must have
looked my mood when I came in, for poor old mammy
had brought me hot toast and tea and delicious peach
jam. I received it with gratitude, but when she began
the recital of that well-known story in which she stood
and received my great aunt’s false teeth in her last
hour, when she launched into my great uncle’s handing
them to her with the words, “Give these into the hands
of this faithful servant,” I leaped up so abruptly that
I frightened her. I wonder if I really meant to pitch
the dear, faithful old soul out the window? I am developing
temperament, or is it temper? Perhaps it is
all due to the outside world. The snow sifts bleakly
from a bleak sky. What am I to do with these walled-round-by-winter
days? What am I to do with this
woman whose outward appearance is mine? She terrifies
me. For thirty years I’ve tended my little
garden plot of life in placid content; cheerfully I’ve
hoed my bean and cabbage rows. Now I want to
dynamite these homely plants. Where the cabbages
stand in rows I want red roses; I can’t abide beans a
minute longer, and in their stead I would like purple
orchids. And there’s something else I want: I want to
cry and cry on a broad man shoulder—not John’s
shoulder. Half timidly I glance over my own shoulder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
as I write it. My own mother never kissed my father
until after they were married, and my grandmother
all her life long dressed and undressed behind the shelter
of the door of the great wardrobe that is here in my
room this very minute, but no reproachful ghosts are
gazing at me. And if all the spinsters in this broad
land with their battle cry of freedom and suffrage (I’ve
got freedom and I’m willing for suffrage) had had the
sort of day I’ve had with the children—it’s been a wild
beast of a day and its sharp claws have drawn blood—when
twilight came they would do just what I am doing
now. They would whisper into the firelit gloom which
invites reckless confidences, as I am whispering, “Eve,
Eve, you want your Paradise, don’t you?” I do solemnly
believe that soon or late this moment comes to
every woman; I do solemnly believe that she can no
more escape this dominant reaching out of her heart,
this dominant yearning for that other one in the world
of two outside of which the rest of humanity is excluded.
Since when have you believed this, Caroline
Howard? Honest now. Face Dicky’s letter—aren’t
you the daughter of a soldier?</p>

<p>This time it’s a big, blond young German—a baron.
A slight accident to his hand brought about the acquaintance.
Always, Dicky “did” his hand for him.
The acquaintance progressed to the point that he knew
her afternoon off. “Of course,” Dicky writes, “it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
flattered me to find him waiting outside the hospital—and
with a taxi.”</p>

<p>It seems they had the gayest of drives, but when
they turned in at the Pennsylvania Station Dicky
demanded the meaning of it. The baron was ready
with an answer. He told her that they were going
away to an ideal life where they would always be together
and always alone. Dicky objected. Her protest
was smothered in the depths of the baron’s hat,
flung quick as magic over her face.</p>

<p>“How I ever emerged from the embrace of that hat
with a smiling face I don’t know. I must thank a
year’s training at the hospital for that. I came out
game—cool on the outside, at any rate. I said: ‘We
can’t go away together without baggage—think of the
scandal of it.’ From the depths of the cab he produced
a big black bag. But I said, ‘That won’t help me.’ It
didn’t work. He said in Washington we would buy
enough clothes to last me forever. I fell in gayly with
his plans. Inside the station he bought tickets to
Washington. I tried to get near the ticket window,
but he flanked the move. There seemed to be no
people in the station. The few that were there were
miles apart in isolated little groups. Just before our
train was called, standing together as alone as if we were
already on the desert to which he said we would go when
we left Washington, a stream of incoming people surged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
up from the left wing of the station. I felt sure one of
the men was Bobby Haralson—he or his double. I
asked the baron to let me say good-bye to an old friend,
as we were never coming back. He agreed.</p>

<p>“‘Aren’t you Mr. Haralson?’ I gasped. ‘If you are,
don’t you remember the little gypsy girl who answered
your ad?’</p>

<p>“‘Sure Mike, I do,’ he said, and swung his bag into
his left hand and gave me a hearty right hand. My
face must have shown that something was wrong, for
he drew me out of the crowd, put down his travelling
bag, and asked me, oh, so quietly, what was wrong.
His quiet manner calmed me. As briefly as I could I
told him. He grasped the situation in a lightning-like
flash. ‘Go back to him,’ he said. ‘Keep cool. I’m
on to the job.’ Had I been on to my job I’d never have
got in that cab. The morning paper says he’s a baron
all right. It says he’s a lunatic all right, too. And he
has been sent to a private asylum.</p>

<p>“He took his arrest quietly. It was so unexpected
it dazed him. I was so limp after it was all over that
Bobby Haralson took me over to the Waldorf and made
me drink a milk punch. Then he brought me home.
We had a heavenly time, and I promised not to be
naughty again.</p>

<p>“At the door, he didn’t come in; he said good-bye
with that smile that lights and warms up his face—you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
remember I told you how reticent and sort of impersonal
he is—and he said next time I wanted an adventure
just send out a wireless and he would answer.
I didn’t tell him about you, Caroline. You have tried
so hard to make a hoyden into a lady that I did not
reveal my identity.”</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>December 8th.</i>
</p>

<p>What an odd, spoiled Bobby! I have a letter from
him. Last fall—the afternoon I went to town and
came back with the ill-fated gown—I sent him the
picture. The P. M. (Particularly Mean) letter was the
little note that demanded its return after we failed to
meet in our promenade down in our yard. Bobby
expects an answer by return mail—it is in every confident
line of his letter. Mr. Robert Haralson, spoiled
darling of your town, once an old lady of my acquaintance
sent her husband across the mountain to get
some “camfire” for her. The gum was dissolved in
whiskey. He drank it and was very sick. I was present
when, convalescent, he humbly asked for chicken
soup. The old lady, with uplifted forefinger said,
“Nary a chicken will ye git.”</p>

<p>See, Mr. Robert Haralson? as you New Yorkers say.</p>

<p>Bobby’s confident letter says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As I write, at my left hand is a basket of letters. I
have just taken from the basket the last nice one you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
wrote me and the awfully mean one you wrote afterward.
The others run back a month or two and none
are answered yet. My right arm is resting on a cushion,
and I am writing with three fingers.</p>

<p>I have been away. In my accumulated mail there
were a couple of letters from you, and the photo you
sent in the lot. The next morning after I got back I
had to send for a doctor. I had got a knock on my
blamed old elbow and she swelled up as big as a prize
beet at the Roseboro County Fair.</p>

<p>Well, old doc said it was cellulitis, which didn’t sound
very reassuring. It comes from having the cellular
tissues hurt. And every day he done that arm up in
plaster and eight miles of bandages. And three or four
times he brung along his knives and lancets and was going
to carving at it, but I wouldn’t let him. I haven’t
been able to write any more than a rabbit. I’m getting
so I can use a small quantity of my fingers now, and
this is the first answer to any letter in the basket.</p>

<p>And that is why I haven’t written to thank you for
the photo, which I appreciate highly, and shall not
return as you suggest in your P. M. (Particularly
Mean) letter. What’s the matter with it? It looks
all right to me. I can’t suggest any improvement in
it. It has lots of your old expression in it, and although
the fool photographer did all he could to spoil it by
making you turn your head as if you were looking to see
if your dress was buttoned all down the back, it’s a
ripping nice picture, and you needn’t want to be “any
better to look at than the picture.” (Can’t you say
the mean things when you want to!)</p>

<p>Now, I wish you’d behave, and take your finger out
of your mouth and stand right there—turn your toes
out—and say you are sorry.</p>

<p>Lemme see!—there was another dig—oh, yes—if I
“had been a pauper or a millionaire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>You bet I’m a pauper now, Miss Carrie. Blowed all
my money in on my trip, and ain’t made any to speak
of since except what doc would carry away with him
every day.</p>

<p>Getting along all right again, though, now. How’s
your writing coming on?</p>

<p>Now will you shake hands again, although it’s my left
one this time?</p>

say in Chicago), but I’ve heard about him—and you
cut him out. He’s an insufferable, measly kid, at the
Sweet Caporal cigarette age, and his graft is to stuff
you provincial writers (I’m speaking impersonally now)
with his taffy so he can get your stuff to peddle around.
Don’t you believe his trick; and you quit sending him
your stuff. He’s trying to make you think you’ve
got George Eliot and Mrs. Humphry Ward beat to a
batter, when you know yourself it ain’t so. Isn’t that
a sage, oh, what a wonderfully sage remark when he
says “you must write your best!”</p>

<p>Don’t you believe “that the editors are asking about
you constantly, and are more than anxious to see your
work.” It’s not so.</p>

<p>Now get mad again, and when that <a id="tn_50">old-time</a> smile
comes back, read on further.</p>

<p>Mein Gott! what a recollection you have of me!
“A tall, slender lad with nice eyes—awfully quiet,
and——Oh, I’ll admit the exceedingly fond.” Was
it a mystery why? Well, I dunno, except because you
were so sweet and devilish.</p>

<p>To-day I am as slender as anybody five feet eight
and weighing 175 pounds could be, and I’ve sharp,
mean eyes. (I told Bobby that he had nice eyes because
I couldn’t remember the colour.) I’ve been taken for
a detective lots of times, but I haven’t changed so
much inside, and if you were on the twentieth floor of
the Waldorf-Astoria to-night, and had a string long
enough, I’ll bet I’d have a magnolia or two and a box
of candy to tie to the end of it.</p>

<p>You speak of meeting old Tom in your letter. Well,
just a few days afterward I got a letter from him talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
about old days. Said he’d been in New York often
and might be back. Lordy! I’d like to see him again.
(Back in the old days at Roseboro Tom was one of the
whistlers under my window the night I got the magnolias.)</p>

<p>Well, now, Carrie, what do <em>you</em> care if Tom pays attention
to somebody and likes her? Ain’t that the
only thing there is that’s worth two cents? Doesn’t
the gentleman that takes you out driving and boat
riding ever—ever—talk about how nice the moon looks?
Oh, Carrie, never get so you feel like running down such
foolishness. After everything is added and subtracted,
<em>that</em> is the only remainder.</p>

<p>On the next page I find the very wise remark of your
friend Miss Baxter (whom I would be glad to consider
mine—I mean mein freund!) that you can’t write a love
story because you know nothing about it. Miss Baxter
is altogether wrong but none the less charming. That
led me to inclose you a little story of mine—a thing that
is apparently egotistical to do—that settles the question
beyond all controversy. Read it some time when you
are up in the arbour about twilight when they are calling
you to supper—but don’t go.</p>

<p>On page three of your letter I observe a reference to
your picture. Sure, Mike! I asked you for your
picture. And I’ve got it, ain’t I? I’d like to see you
get it back!</p>

<p>Oh, Carrie, if you “knowed” how folks try to get
letters from me and can’t, you’d appreciate the delightful
toil I take in writing to you. Ordinarily it’s just
like laying bricks for me to write even a business letter,
but when I write to you—lemme see what to say—it’s
like lifting the lightest feather from the breast of an
eider duck and watching it float through the circumambient
atmosphere. (That strike you hard enough?)</p>

<p>I’ll tell you what, Carrie—(now don’t get mad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
Caroline) I need a boss. For the last month I’ve been
so no-account and lazy that I haven’t turned out a
line. And yet, I don’t think it’s exactly my fault.
I’ve felt kind of melancholy and dreamy and lonesome,
and I don’t sleep well of nights. Once I dreamed that
I had a magnolia for you and you turned up your nose
at it and went away with Jeff—you remember Jeff?</p>

<p><cite>Everybody’s Magazine</cite> sent down the editor’s automobile
and took me uptown to a distinguished nerve
specialist, who decided that I had been working too
hard, and advised me either to take a trip to Europe
or some tablets he had in a box. I took the tablets.
They didn’t taste bad, so I kept on taking ’em, and I
ain’t a bit worse to-day.</p>

<p>But none of ’em knew that what I needed was just
somebody to fix a cushion for me on the sofa, and tell
the man with the gas bill that I wasn’t in.</p>

<p>You asked me what I get for short stories. I get
ten, fifteen, sometimes twenty cents a word, and everything
engaged long before it’s written.</p>

<p>Now, I’ll tell you what to do: kick the mountains
over and hurry to New York. It’s 50 per cent. of the
game to see the editors in person. Right here is the
only place on the American Continent where you can
live. What are the mountains compared to it? Dear
Carrie, kick the mountains over and take my advice.
You are far enough advanced to make your way from
the start. And I assure you, as I said, being on the
ground is 50 per cent of the game.</p>

<p>They call it a lonely city. Lonely! with every masterpiece
of art, music, and beautiful things within a
block of you! Say, Carrie, chop down the tomato
vines and come on. I can get you into every editorial
office in town (where you are not already appreciated),
and you will make a success. Attend, oh, Princess of
the Bluest Ridge, these are not the words of one D.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Hudson the adolescent, but of Bob the Perspicacious,
who has seen and who knows. If I didn’t think you
had the genius to win the game I’d never advise you to
try.</p>

<p>There’s a line in your letter—“I couldn’t know what
the boy had developed into.” I can only say into one
surely no better, unsatisfied, and always remembering
the little girl next door.</p>

<p>Please, Carrie, write to me soon, and if you don’t
like my letter say you condone it, for there ain’t nobody
up here like you, and I’m awfully lonesome to-night.
And so, may I sign myself,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="p-r45"><span class="smcap">Yours as ever</span>,</span><br>

Bob.</p>

<p>P.S. I’m awfully glad to see by the weather reports
that there’s a freeze coming. I hope the gent that
rows you on the lake will have to buy tacks to put in
his oars.</p>

<p>P.P.S. I was in a thanksgiving party where we had
a flashlight photo taken. I’ll send you one when they
are printed.</p>

<span class="p-r1"><i>Christmas Eve.</i></span><br>
<span class="p-r05"><i>Midnight.</i></span>
</p>

<p>It is snowing—a real snow. The night outside my
windows is one soft whirling blur. At dusk John came
in from the twenty-mile-away town. He shook the
snow from his clothes like the traditional Santa Claus,
and he was just as full of bundles. Two express packages
for me in the big, bold hand grown so familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
set my heart to beating and my cheeks to blushing
furiously under John’s scalpel eyes.</p>

<p>Since nine o’clock, when John went to bed tired out
with his hard day’s journey, I have sat here in my bedroom,
dim save for the light of the leaping flames and
silent save for the sift of the snow piling high and higher
on the window-panes. Luxuriously I dive again into
the most wonderful box of candy I ever dreamed of;
luxuriously I sniff the perfume of the most exquisite
flowers I ever saw, across the snow-filled air the village
bells ring their faint, “Peace on earth, good-will to
men.”</p>

<p>To-morrow when I wear my flowers to church, I’ll
feel like a princess—orchids and lilies of the valley—your
princess, Bobby.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>Christmas Day.&nbsp; Afternoon.</i>
</p>

<p>When my eyes opened this morning the flaming
beauty of the east took me to the window—such a
marshalling of sunrise banners to do honour to the
day. Not waiting for my fire, judging from the sounds
in that direction that mammy was having a holiday
nap, anyway, I dressed rapidly, high shoes, short skirt,
coat and cap, and sallied forth. The landscape stretched
before me like a vast white sea, its purity unbroken by
footstep of man. It seemed to belong solely to me and
a few noisy crows. I marched straight to the post-office.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
It was closed when John passed last night. I had a
sneaking little hope—but it wasn’t there. I got a little
note from Dicky, though. She writes that her gift is
delayed. It is always. I could never teach Dicky
timeliness—always, like Bobby Haralson, she has been
superior to time.</p>

<p>The day that I began joyously has been a restless
one. I have climbed to the hilltop. Below me the
village lies, a crystal toy town in the lap of crystal
hills. My eyes travel down the chain of glistening
hills to Camel Back. Wise old comrade, I do believe
he knows. Anyway, it is a relief to tell him. “Camel
Back,” she writes, “A chance encounter at the theatre
with Bobby Haralson in which I still conceal my identity.”
Camel Back’s snowy hump twinkles as though
he laughs; above him the clouds that have seemed to
drift aimlessly form a fairy castle. Its turrets and dome
glitter in the sunset’s dying fire. I can trace a door—a
vast, closed portal. How ridiculous that a trick of
the clouds could thrill me! Slowly the door has opened.
I can’t explain the lovely magic of it, but there
in the white stillness some words that Bobby wrote
rolled over me in a great, mounting, singing wave.</p>

<p>“You have sympathy and a deep and true humanness.”
If Bobby is not mistaken! If it could be! Almost
solemnly I turn from my mountain, with its castle
fading from the sky, and take my way home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>January 20th.</i>
</p>

<p>Every minute that I can spare from my school duties
I work at my book in a fury of enthusiasm. Just as
the snow made the village so beautiful on Christmas
day, something within me no longer sees the frailties
of the mountain people with whom my lot is cast.
Their kindness through all the long years comes to me
instead. So I call my little book “The Window.” I
look out and see beauties I never saw before, and the
sun pours in and warms me.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>January 25th.</i>
</p>

<p>I am working at it night and day. It grows amazingly.
“Child,” some one said to me yesterday, “I heard
ye was writin’ a book. Ain’t plenty o’ books in the worl’,
’thout rackin’ yore pore brains to write anuther?”</p>

<p>Almost, I gave back indignant answer; but I have
learned of my little book—of my little book that flows
in my veins and runs down through my finger-tips,
sometimes to laugh and exult, sometimes to sob and
sigh.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>February 15th.</i>
</p>

<p>My book is written. It was pure joy. It is very
simple—just the hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows
of this spot isolated from the big world by its wall of
mountains. I owe much to my book. Winter still
holds the world, but flowers bloom inside me. Not the
orchids and roses I demanded of life when I wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
dynamite my garden plot, it is true, but some old-fashioned
pinks that make these February days sweet
and smelly ones.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>March 1st.</i>
</p>

<p>Did it ever happen to anybody before? I have
knocked and knocked at editors’ doors; I have waited
months and got my stories back, too. Two weeks,
and I hold in my hand a telegram from Bobby’s publishers:
“Your little book is ours, and it’s love at first
sight.”</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>April 1st.</i>
</p>

<p>It is advertised in the magazine section of the <cite>Times</cite>.
How it flashes out to meet my eyes: “The Window”—a
certain simplicity of expression—a realism that
touches with delicacy and pathos things that we feel
are the actualities of life.</p>

<p>John comes in and brings Dicky’s letter: “Caroline
Howard! And not to tell me! Such a peach of a heroine,
Caroline. How’d a sedate old thing like you catch
that spirit of youth? Your heroine flames like a red,
red rose. And what do you know of love’s sweetness
and its fierceness?”</p>

<p>What do I know? I go indoors and gaze soberly at
the sedate old thing that is I. Then I go in search of
mammy. “Mammy,” I call, “I <em>must</em> have somebody
to talk to. They say you can look right into the
shadowy interiors of the mountaineers’ cabins; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
you can see the vague objects take shape in them because
I’ve got the atmosphere so well.” Mammy is
feeding the chickens. “What is atmosphere, honey?”
she asks calmly. “Oh, feed your chickens,” I say,
disgustedly, and, calmly, she obeys.</p>

<p>By some queer trick our publishers, Bobby’s and
mine, have put us together—my little book by his big
book. I have not heard from Bobby since Christmas.
No doubt all his fingers are now out of commission.</p>

<p>Just after Christmas I was in town and I saw a big
splendid picture of Bobby in a bookdealer’s window.
I know the man, and, shamelessly, I told him Bobby
was my first cousin—my favourite cousin. He gave
me the picture. Bobby is in his old place on my
mantel. And, as before, he dominates the room.
There are times when I almost feel his presence, distinct,
encompassing. My life has not many idle moments,
but when these little lazy let-down minutes do
come, when I sit by the fire at night, the school papers
all corrected, just before I go to bed, I find awaiting
me, giving me the feeling that it is always there, patiently
abiding its moment, this nearness to Bobby.
It draws near, not like an alien thing unsure of its welcome,
but it comes as if in answer to a call. How well
I know Bobby Haralson! Times spent together, when
apart, how close they come. If disaster overwhelmed
him he’d hide his hurt under a froth of gayety, his lips<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
would mock with smiles. Once my mother laughingly
called my father to see the pretty picture a little sewing
girl made as she slept—her beads of prayer in her
hands. Smilingly my father shook his head. My
mother loved my father for that chivalry to a little
sleeping work girl. Bobby is like that—human enough
to advertise through a newspaper for a girl “pal” and
then too chivalrous to meet her. The subtle gradations
that make a gentleman!</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>April 1st.</i>
</p>

<p>All the way from school this afternoon I kept telling
myself there would be a letter from Bobby on the hall
table, and then I would tell myself it was preposterous
after this long silence that I should look for his letter.
But there it was. And he has been sick. I feel his
nerves in the letter.</p>

<p>If Bobby has been reading my last two letters, which
he hopes I won’t make my two last, one was most certainly
an old one. Of course I thanked him for the
Christmas flowers and candy. It’s a bad sign, Mr.
Book-writer, for a man to con over old letters. He’s
either in his dotage, or he is in love. Is Bobby in love?</p>

<p>Here’s his letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p1 right">
<span class="p-r1"><i>West 20th Street.</i></span><br>
<i>New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; April 1st.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear, dear Carrie</span>:</p>

<p>(Dear, dear Carrie, indeed! And not a line from him
since Christmas.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Here’s my right hand being held up:—Please listen!</p>

<p>To-day for the first time in six weeks I’ve had my
trunks unpacked and have sat down at my desk clothed
in my ordinarily sane mind, and been able to find pen
’n ink ’n paper to write with and on. I’ve moved four
times since I lived in Waverly Place; and have been
driven from post-office to pillow by the—noise of elevated
trains, waggons (notice the English two g’s), trams
(also English), and cries of hucksters (mostly Dagoes).
At last I have found a quiet haven; and the first
thing I do (of course) is to dig your last two (please
don’t make it “two last”) letters and read ’em some
more.</p>

<p>I have answered your letters and written you dozens
in the spirit; but when it comes to spreading the ink, I
know I’ve been as the old darky song goes, “A liar and
a conjurer, too.” There are periods of time when the
sight of a pen or an ink bottle strikes me to stone. Will
it be some slight excuse for not having written to one
of whom I have thought by every mail, if I assert that
not for months have I written a line for publication
except one little short 2,000-word <em>rotten</em> story? It be
true.</p>

<p>Oh, some sort of nervous condition—can’t sleep nor
nothin’! Oh, yes, ma’am, thank you; feelin’ heaps
better now. I live within a few doors of Broadway, but
on such a quiet street that the little clock on my desk
ticking sounds as loud as a cricket chirping under the
honeysuckle vine on your porch on a fall night.</p>

<p>Don’t you think you might come up this way some
time? Ain’t there some of your folks that live around
here? Seems to me there was. I’d rather see you than
to have a bushel of diamonds. And if I can get a
string on you I’ll tie more magnolias and gumdrops to
it than Roseboro ever saw. Say—please come, won’t
you? I do so long to see a human—a Heaven-sent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
home-bred, ideal-owning, scrumptious, sweet, wholesome
human with a heart such as I know you are—or,
in the words of the poet, “one of whom you are which.”
The folks up here are all right and lots of ’em are good
to know, but—they ain’t got tar on their heels, Miss
Carrie, ma’am.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking of running down to the Bluest
Ridge for two or three weeks as soon as it gets warmer
here. I want to go up somewhere in the mountings
and have a quiet time with the sunrises and the squirrels,
and I want to see some morning glories on a board
fence. I’ve tried the dinky little hills they call mountains
up here, and they ain’t no good. You can’t take
forty steps in the wildwood without stumbling over a
sardine box or a salmon can; and the quantity of Ikeys
and Rebeccas that you scare up in the shady dells is
sure something fierce.</p>

<p>If I happen down in your range of mountings may I
drop in and see you? I need to get away from town for
a while, and I certainly would rather be there than anywhere
I know of.</p>

<p>Why don’t you cut loose and come to N. Y.? This is
the only place to live. You can choose the kind of life
you want and live it, and get all there is of existence.
Come on and get in with the bunch! You can get a
studio in a top story and raise tomatters on the roof if
you must have ’em. I’ll help you tend to ’em. Come
on and learn the beauty of a quiet life. Get away from
the feverish round of gayeties that you’ve been accustomed
to—men taking you out rowing (wasn’t he tall
and dark, with a drooping moustache?) and men coming
in the Pullman cars and sitting close by your side—oh,
I haven’t forgotten about it! Often I’ve gotten
out a couple of dozen sheets of paper and started to
write to you, when I’d think: oh, what’s the use—she
won’t want to hear from me—somebody’s ripping the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
buttonholes out of his collar trying to pull up car windows
for her, or pulling on the wrong oar and rowing
the boat into a mud bank where they’ll sit for hours
until some plowman plods along and drags them out.</p>

<p>Please, dear Carrie, write to me some more. If you
had saved all the letters I’ve written to you in the
spirit you’d have a stack as high as the big sunflower
by the garden gate. Write and tell me exactly what
you think about when you take your hair down and sit
on the rug at 11:30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> before the fireplace. And I’ll
tell you what I think about when I set the bottle of
Scotch on the table and light the last cigar at 2 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>,
when the distant cars and cabs sound like the ripples of
your mountain streams on a still summer night.</p>

<p>I send the ghost of a magnolia up to your window.</p>

<p>If you come to N. Y. this spring I reckon as how you
won’t want to see me because you think I am short on
etiquette. All right for youse! I’ll watch all the
rubberneck coaches, and when I see a little pink-cheeked
girl in a straw hat with daisies on it and a white

<p>This sweet spring afternoon I cannot stay indoors.
In her joy the earth is like the mother of a new-born
child. A light, restless wind has piled snowy, errant
clouds above the mountain tops, the little green leaves
are uncurling, the sun shining as it shines only in the
spring and on an awakened world—and the birds——A
lover bird, just the kind to capture a little lady bird’s
heart, has been pouring out a passionate mating song
for two whole days. He is in the cedar tree not far
from my window. His little lady love answers from
the willow in the pasture. He is <a id="tn_63">trying</a> to make her
come to him, I feel sure. Will she?</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<span class="p-r15"><i>April 6th.</i></span><br>
<i>Saturday Afternoon.</i>
</p>

<p>My lover bird is gone from the cedar tree. Down in
the willow’s cool depths, above the spring where the
colts and cattle drink, there are such flutterings, such
joyous little outbursts of song that I smile in sympathy.
Wise, wise, little woman-bird. Since the coming of
these last letters there’s been a stealthy fear following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
at my heels—the fear that I might go to New York.
I could make my book an excuse, and I have some
money. I have spent very little since that extravagant
outburst last fall. And I could make Dicky an excuse.
Dear little Dicky, who is as joyous over my book as if
she herself had written it.</p>

<p>I will not go! The fate that let me put the light out
the night that Bobby came here is a wicked, wicked
jade, but I defy her! I’ll stay right here!</p>

<p>That Bobby should remember a little girl’s hat
through all the years! That day so far in the past,
when I left Roseboro and Ernest Cold was on the train—Bobby
said he was; I don’t remember—Bobby put
a real daisy in my hat band when he came in the train
to tell me good-bye, and he said——</p>

<p>That stealthy fear that I might go to New York is
stealthy no longer. Boldly it has stalked out in front
of me and clutched me by the throat.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>April 15th.</i>
</p>

<p>This morning when I pushed up the shade in my
berth I was greeted by the sun’s big, round, inquiring
eye. “What are you doing here?” he seemed to be
asking. I hastened to explain that my going to New
York was in no way connected with Mr. Robert Haralson;
that he is not to know I am there. Somewhat
shamefacedly I explain to that red, watchful eye that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Dicky is not to know I am there either. Dicky doesn’t
need me now. Her last letter is as joyous as the lilt of
a lark.</p>

<p>My publishers (how fine it sounds) want some little
changes made in the book, and for that sole reason I
am on a Pullman bound for New York.</p>

<p>So accustomed am I to space that I could not be
boxed up in lower twelve last night, so I took the whole
section. This morning as I stood on my bed reaching
up for my skirt the train took a sharp curve that landed
me in the aisle of the car. Visions of a hospital danced
with a million stars before my eyes. A young, lovely
girl helped me back into my berth. No one else, not
even the porter, had witnessed my humiliation. In a
little while, in spite of my aching head, I collected my
senses sufficiently to get to the dressing-room. Making
myself presentable was a clutching sort of experience.
I have not spent the night in a train since I was eighteen,
and I must have been more agile then. When I
emerged from dressing I felt as a mountaineer’s baby
must feel when it is being hushed to sleep. If you have
ever seen one being flung from side to side of its rude
little cradle, threshed about like a weaver’s shuttle,
then you understand perfectly.</p>

<p>The girl was waiting for me; she proposed that we
breakfast together. In the dining car, under the stimulus
of the coffee, which stopped my headache, I told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the girl about my little book and that I was going on
for my first trip. Back in the coach we were the only
passengers and we sat together; she told me about herself.
She is going to New York, too. She is going to
join the great army of workers. She is so sweet and
young, so girlish and refined, so beautifully although
simply dressed, that I think my face must have shown
my astonishment and regret. That she should be
adrift in a great city seemed too dreadful—one of its
labourers, and on small wages, in desolate lodgings,
isolated from all social life with her kind. I thought of
the city’s temptations for a lonely, beautiful girl. And
I said: “Child, go back to your family. Haven’t you
somebody?”</p>

<p>“I have my little baby that lies in the cemetery.”
Her young laugh rang bitter. “I am all alone. I left
my husband—he didn’t love baby and me any longer.
I mean he didn’t love me. He adored baby. She
adored him, too. She used to say, ‘I’m des trazy ’bout
my dear daddy.’” She looked from the window; I
could see her chin quiver. When she turned back to
me her voice was quite steady. “I want to be fair
to him. When baby died it hurt him cruelly, and always
when I place flowers in the little urn at the head of
baby’s grave, I find beautiful ones in the urn at the
foot. I know, although he does not love me any longer,
that it hurts him for me to be a wage-earner. But I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
can’t take his money. You—you don’t believe in
divorce?” Her voice was half timid.</p>

<p>I was silent. It is something I am so ignorant of.
The old Ducketts are the nearest approach to divorce
that we have in our mountain world. Recently, without
a word to any one, that poor old lady left her home
and moved to a little house across the street. Our
village has wondered and gossiped about this rupture
after sixty years of life together. Poor old lady, she
slips in the back door of his house when he is sitting
at the front door, and does up the work she has done for
sixty years; then she slips home again.</p>

<p>“A woman can’t judge”—the girl’s voice with a defiant
note in it brought my thoughts with a start back
from the Ducketts, and to her—“unless it is her own
problem. She, the other woman, wanted him to leave
baby and me. He dropped the letter on the floor and
I picked it up and read it. I don’t know why I did it.
I had perfect faith in him. She said all her happiness
was at stake; she eliminated our happiness—baby’s
and mine.”</p>

<p>“But, child”—my mind took a wider circle than it
had ever had need of in Marsville—“any woman might
fall in love with another woman’s husband and try to
take him from her. I know a coloured woman whose
husband beats her, and when I try to make her leave
him and live on a nice little place we have and do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
our washing, she says she would leave her old man
but that she might not find another, that husbands
is so ‘scase.’ They must be from the way some
women behave. Perhaps your husband was not at
fault.”</p>

<p>The lovely colour mounted to her face, it quivered
as she told me that he had acknowledged it. We were
both silent then. But presently I asked if he had gone
to the other woman. She murmured no.</p>

<p>“He says that he is penitent.” Her eyes were
stormy. “He begs me to take him back. Upon what
foundation would I build my faith in him again?”</p>

<p>I think my own answer surprised me. “Bodies
sometimes sin when souls are clean,” I said. “It
could have been a passing sin of the body that did not
touch the spirit, which is still true to you. If the spirit
sinned he would not want to come back—he would not
be sorry. Oh, child, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“I never—did see—it like—that.” The girl’s words
trailed like broken winged birds, her face paled.</p>

<p>We were under the shed in Washington and a solitary
passenger, travelling bag in hand, was coming
down the aisle of our coach. At sight of her, for he did
not know me, his face whitened, too. In one great
throb of my heart I took in the situation. I knew that
he was her husband, and that he loved her. I saw it
in the flash of his face at sight of her—a blind man given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
back his sight might look out on his restored world
with a look like that.</p>

<p>In a lightning-like flash of time I had leaped to my
feet, pushed him into the seat where I had been, and,
without in the least knowing what I was saying, I
heard myself say: “You foolish children. Go back to
the little grave and put the two urns for flowers together.
Then start life all over again.”</p>

<p>I left them staring into each other’s eyes in a sort of
mesmerized trance, and went into the next coach.
When my eyes cleared of tears I saw that the bright
sunlight world beyond the car window was filled with
yellow butterflies. In their circling they made a great
golden wedding ring. The sweet prophecy seemed
mine—not belonging to the people I had left back in
the other coach. At lunch they asked me to come to
their table, but I smilingly refused. When two people
have just been caught up in a golden chariot and given
passage direct to Paradise there is no room in the
vehicle for outsiders.</p>

<p>I could not grind under the river and get out in the
heart of the city, as the advertisements say. I had
to see the skyline from the Jersey side. How wonderful
it is as it glitters in the soft spring light—a proud
wonder city that rests on great, tossing waters. And
there lie the docks. I can read the names of the different
lines on the dark little houses. And far down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
stretch of moving water I see a gallant little tug assisting
a great vessel out to sea. A sort of trembling seized
me. Like a vision that fades, all thought of the life
that lay behind me—John, mammy, the little mountain
village—slipped away. As the boat drifts near and
nearer to that white wonder city I want to fling the
people huddled on the seats, apathetic as sheep, into
the water. I want to cry aloud, “City, city, I am
coming!” But they wake up at the dock. How alive
they are! I am alive, too. I am over the mountain
wall. At last I am part of the big, alive, throbbing
world.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>April 16th.</i> 12 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>
</p>

<p>Late yesterday afternoon when I ran up the steps of
30 West Twentieth Street and the door opened and
closed on me, my one sensation was relief. I had
taken a cab at the ferry and I had marvelled at the
dexterity with which the cabby turned and twisted
through the dingy streets. Safe, not kidnapped, money
still in my bag, the wonderful adventure of getting to my
destination without adventure accomplished, I stepped
from that cab. The cabby took my trunk from the top
of his hansom, banged it on the sidewalk, accepted the
dollar we had agreed upon, and waited. I waited, too,
politely. Suddenly he turned very red and climbed to
his perch, swearing roundly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>As I followed Miss Jackson up the stairs to the third
floor I asked her why he did that. She answered
vaguely that they were rude.</p>

<p>I came to Miss Jackson’s because her mother and my
mother knew each other, and because it is eminently
respectable. As we climbed the dark stairs my elation
dropped from me. The hall needs the winds of heaven
to blow through it. Coming back to dinner, I fairly
groped through the dimness. But the dining-room
was bright and cheerful. All the people seemed young.
They were very gay. At dinner the whole talk was of
the theatre. As I have not been to a play since I was
eighteen, I sat stupidly quiet. Everybody went out
after dinner—most of them to the theatre. Miss
Jackson went, too. Up in my room I leaned from the
window and tried to realize the wonderfulness of being
in New York. Below me the street was dark, but far
away across the housetops I saw a glow that I took to
be the lights of Broadway. After a long time I stole
down the dim, depressing stairs. I opened the door,
let in the sweet, cool April air. I don’t know how long
I stood there looking out at the dark, deserted street.
I thought of it as a siren of the sea, calling, luring to it
the youth of our wide, free land. My mind went to
my little room up two dark flights of stairs. I was
paying ten dollars a week for a room just about the
size of the rug in front of my fireplace at home. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
was the size of the working girl’s room who paid five
dollars a week? How many flights of dark stairs did
she have to climb? I seemed to feel the city—the city
that I have not yet seen. I seemed to feel its immensity—stretching
away, street after street, in overpowering
sameness the length of the island. I thought of the
overcrowded East Side and the foreigners herded like
cattle, overflowing into the streets, and then I thought of
Bobby—or had I been thinking of him through all my
thoughts?—jostling in the crowded streets, loitering,
listening, feeling the beat of the city’s great heart.</p>

<p>When I closed the door and came down the hall I saw
the telephone in spite of the dimness. Almost before
I knew it I had found the number I sought, my hand
was on the receiver. But I did not take it down. The
memory of a bright-eyed little lady bird who waited
for her lover to come to her restrained me. I must be
as wise as she.</p>

<p>I ran up to my room. A fog had crept in from the
sea. The river must be near. The calls of whistles
and horns came shrill and often. They seemed to give
anxious warning. The city <em>is</em> a siren. It wrapped
itself closer in this white fog sheet of mystery and it
called to me. Hastily I donned coat and hat, ran down
the stairs and out on the street. I did not hesitate—to
hesitate was to go back. In front of me, not far
away, another street opened. I reached it, stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
still for a moment; a wraithlike little figure hurried
past. “What street is this?” I asked. Wraithlike
he sped on without a reply. I hurried after him, caught
him by the arm. “What street is this?” I insisted.
“And which is up and which down?”</p>

<p>“Whut’s de matter wid y’nut?”</p>

<p>Humbly, I told him that I was a stranger; that I
lived near and had just walked out for a little glimpse
of the city. He told me to keep straight ahead until
I came to Twenty-third Street, and stand there a while
till the hayseeds fell off me. I gave him a dime. He
graciously allowed me to accompany him. The city
street widens beautifully at Twenty-third. It had
seemed like one of our narrow mountain gulches. I
gave my little lad another dime. I wanted to be told
so much. The open space, vague in the fog, is Madison
Square; the street that rolled away into the gloom,
the Avenue, and the white, white foggy flare of light,
Broadway.</p>

<p>Some weight of the city’s loneliness fell on me as I
retraced my steps alone. The fog seemed denser—it
might have been because the light lay behind. A few
blocks down, as I turned into my own street, my own
audacious thoughts brought me to a standstill. If I
kept straight on I would come to Washington Square.
An old schoolmate lived there.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in recognizing the Arch, the cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
on the church, the light that burns always. I found
the number. I would have thought I had made a
mistake, but I have written it so often. I went up the
bare, worn steps, rang a jangly bell. A slatternly
woman came to the door. Back of her I could see a
dingy hall lighted by a blinking gas jet. She called
my friend loudly. There was no reply. She said her
work was heavier in the spring, that she was often very
late.</p>

<p>I had pictured my artist friend in her studio home
surrounded with comfort. “Hasn’t she a studio?” I
stammered. The woman laughed loudly. “Her room,
third floor back, ain’t no bigger ’n yo’ hand. She
paints an’ sews an’ cooks, eats an’ lives an’ sleeps there,
’cept when she got jobs out.”</p>

<p>I turned and fled. I was trembling so I could hardly
stand. Such a fragile, lovely creature—my friend
back in my school-girl days. A joyous young creature,
fashioned for joy. I did not want to see her; I knew
instinctively that she did not want to see me.</p>

<p>On the street again, out of the foggy darkness, a
shadow lurched toward me. I shrank against the
building I was passing. It bent and looked into my
face, laughed drunkenly, and passed on. I tried to
move. My limbs had taken root. As I stood there
flattened against that wall I heard cautious, descending
footsteps, whispering voices. Some people were coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
down nearby steps, and I was glad. I would follow
close behind them. After what was to me a very long
time, as they did not pass, I went in the direction of
their voices, until I stumbled over a dark mass that lay
in my path. Something told me. The slow, cautious
steps, the whispering voices—I dropped to my knees
on the pavement. The face I lifted and looked into
was a young girl’s. She was unconscious. I sprang
up. There was movement in my limbs now. I ran,
breathless, into a man. I caught him by the arm,
pleading with him to hurry; I dragged him to the girl
on the pavement. I gasped out all I knew.</p>

<p>He took a flashlight from somewhere about him,
knelt, looked at the girl, and I—I looked at the pool of
blood widening on the pavement. I had not seen it before.
She was dying. I dropped down by her, too.
“Oh, poor little girl,” I cried, “why did you come to
this city of Gomorrha? Why didn’t you stay at
home?”</p>

<p>“See here”—the light flashed full in my own face,
the low, cold voice bit into my spirit as a bullet of steel
might have burrowed in my flesh—“how do I know
that what you’ve told me is on the level?”</p>

<p>Stupidly I stared at him. Whose face was this—as
familiar as my own viewed in the looking-glass?</p>

<p>The eyes looking into mine were suddenly confused,
the apology he gave murmured. He stared as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
I bewildered him. He pushed his hat back. I hadn’t
recognized Bobby Haralson, but I knew that lock of
hair on his brow. Had I not once watched a flame devour
it? Head and heart awhirl, I smiled at him.
“Mr. Haralson,” I said, and I laughed outright. “I
am on the level.”</p>

<p>There was the sound of approaching footsteps. He
flashed the light out. “So you know me?” he said.</p>

<p>“Who does not?” I answered. “But you do not
know me, honest, now.”</p>

<p>“I do—and I don’t,” he said.</p>

<p>Not far away a figure loomed; it brought us back to
the poor little girl that lay there so quietly between us.</p>

<p>“You must get away, quickly. Officer!” he called.
His voice has a carrying quality if it is so low, for soon
an answering hail came through the fog.</p>

<p>“Will you go? Go!” he commanded. “I’ll see
this through.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” I said, and I suddenly knew that I spoke
out of a vast content. “I’m lost. It’s no use to tell
me west. I don’t know west.”</p>

<p>“West what?” Again his words bit into me like
they were steel.</p>

<p>“Twenty.” The officer was only a few steps away
and Bobby fairly forced it from me.</p>

<p>“The Arch, the Avenue, Twentieth Street, then to
your left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>Obediently, I did it all. I am safe at Miss Jackson’s.
But, oh, will I ever sleep again? When I close my eyes
I see the girl’s fair little face, that widening pool of
blood; and then I see Bobby’s eyes—the puzzled stir
of memory in them.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>April 17th.</i>
</p>

<p>I fell asleep at daylight this morning. When I
waked the breeze was tossing the curtains, the sun
shining, there was a sense of joyousness in the morning.
I shopped with an agent—I could not have shopped
without one. We lunched at a cunning tearoom just
off the Avenue. I ordered just about what mammy
would have for a guest of ours: soup, broiled chicken,
two vegetables, a salad, a sweet, and coffee. I nearly
fainted when I saw my bill. And then the tip! I
would not have given it, but I saw it offered at a nearby
table. I was confused to give it, but the pretty, refined
looking girl did not seem to mind accepting it.</p>

<p>This afternoon, by appointment, I met Mr. Elliott.
Mr. Elliott is a member of the firm. He is young,
tall, slender. Somehow I thought all publishers were
middle-aged, stocky as to build, and with close-cut
white moustaches.</p>

<p>Mr. Elliott asked me if I had ever dined at Mouquin’s.
His face was a compliment when I told him
that like a little mountain boy of my acquaintance I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
had never “ben nowhar nur seen nothin’.” I <em>do like</em>
Mr. Elliott. My heart is almost leaping out of me!
I drove straight to Mrs. Christopher again. She told
me all the literary people go to Mouquin’s. If Bobby
should be there to-night! If we should meet!</p>


<p class="right">
<i>One</i> <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>
</p>

<p>Out of gratitude to Mrs. Christopher I must acknowledge
that the girl who looked back at me from the
mirror to-night was a stranger to me. Mr. Elliott
did not know her, either. As I came down the boarding-house
stairs—the parlours at present are occupied by
people from the South and the stuffy hall is the only
reception-room—I flushed under his gaze. It is most
bewildering to emerge from a Marsville spinster to a
New York belle.</p>

<p>Mouquin’s. A confused memory of a flight of steps,
a clutter of tables, a sea of faces.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you hungry? Don’t you like your oysters?
It is a trifle late for them.”</p>

<p>We were seated. I knew that. It was Mr. Elliott’s
voice. I knew that, too. I was glad, although he
seemed so far away, that I had not lost him. The plate
that was rising, falling, lurchingly, drunkenly, held
oysters——</p>

<p>“Drink your cocktail.” Out of the blur of things he
pushed it toward me. Obediently I drank it. I saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
that the oysters numbered six, that their shells were as
pink and polished as a lady’s finger-nails. Obediently
I ate them—the oysters, not the shells.</p>

<p>“What makes you so quiet to-night? But maybe
you aren’t having a good time?”</p>

<p>With the help of the wine that sparkled and bubbled
at my right hand, blessed little helper in time of need,
I did not have to give account of my appetite again;
I was making quite respectable headway with my
chicken. Feverishly I assured Mr. Elliott that I was
having the loveliest time but one I’d ever had in my
life.</p>

<p>Mr. Elliott beamed. “Will you tell me about that
time?” he asked.</p>

<p>But women have their little reserves. The lovely
time to which I had reference was a mountain storm
I once survived, on Craggy, six thousand feet above
sea level, separated from my party, having followed a
cattle path by mistake, and—<em>alone</em>. This time was just
as lovely as that. Then, after a terrified scurrying
here and there, I had gone back to the mountain top to
wait. Out of what had seemed an innocent sky an
electric storm broke. Lashing his steeds with whips of
fire, Apollo drove them across the boiling heavens.
At each ear-crashing report of thunder the earth threatened
to crumble, hurling me down through bottomless
space. With the sharp hissings of snakes the lightning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
fell about me. Rain-drenched, storm-torn, but too
terrified to brave the electric fires darting across the
mountain’s top to what seemed safety under the big
rock where a flock of frightened sheep huddled, I took
the storm in the open. When it had rolled away the
sheep no longer huddled—I was indeed alone—they
lay still.</p>

<p>“Does it meet your approval?” Mr. Elliott put the
direct question to me, and somehow I knew it had been
asked before. I looked down at my plate helplessly—we
had reached the salad course—I tried to rouse my
laggard brain. Approval of what, and what was approval?</p>

<p>“It gets my goat!” The words came from my lips.
My ears heard them. And the fright of the foolish
words cleared my brain.</p>

<p>“What!” There was astonishment, there was amusement,
there was also a puzzled intentness in the eyes
that looked into mine, and I stammered that the girl
who sat at the next table—the girl who looked so cultured
and smartly got up—had just said it, and that
it was new to me, but it sounded like an idiom of the
street.</p>

<p>With that careless, satiated New York glance Mr.
<a id="tn_80">Elliott’s</a> eyes swept the girl. “Beef to the heel,” he
said heartlessly.</p>

<p>“Beef to the heel!” That puzzled me, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>We had drained our coffee cups when two people
who sat at a table behind us passed—a man and a woman—Bobby
Haralson and Dicky. I recognized Bobby
as I came in; the lovely droop of Dicky’s back is not
unfamiliar to me, either.</p>

<p>“That’s Bob Haralson—you’ve heard of him—one
of our biggest men, and his biggest work is still in him.
He’s the nicest, most lovable, queerest fellow you ever
did see. He has hosts of friends, but mostly, he lives
to himself. He’d give his last dollar to a friend and
go hungry himself; and once I knew him to refuse to be
introduced to a rich fellow of power in the literary
world because that man belonged soul and body to a
corporation—had been bought. That’s Bob Haralson!
I often see him here, but I never saw him here with a
woman before. Come to think of it, I never saw him
anywhere before with a woman—not much in his line,
women. But they seemed to be having a corking
time. I never saw him so animated. That little
witch—pretty, wasn’t she?—has got him going. I’d
have asked him over to be introduced had he been
alone.”</p>

<p>As we left the restaurant Mr. Elliott asked me to go
with him to a little theatre where the one-act plays
were all thrills. I couldn’t tell him that if I had any
more thrills he’d probably have to call an ambulance
and send me to a hospital; I couldn’t explain that as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
far as I was concerned the play was done, curtain down,
and lights out.</p>

<p>We went. We sat in darkness. The darkness was
a great relief. Mr. Elliott could not see me. I sat
there with tightly shut eyes until, at a stir among the
people about me, I heard some one say a man had
fainted. “It gets my goat!” I murmured. Fortunately
there was quite a little stir about us and Mr.
Elliott did not hear me.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>April 18th.</i>
</p>

<p>Some hours ago, when I left New York, having decided
to run up to Plymouth and finish up the work on
the book by the sea, Mr. Elliott put me in the coach,
having showered me with books, flowers, and magazines.
I opened the flowers in the cab, and I stared at
them and at him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like them?”</p>

<p>Did I like orchids and lilies of the valley? Bobby’s
Christmas gift to me? I pulled up. I wasn’t going
to be beef to the heel. I joined the New York procession—and
I think I made good.</p>

<p>There’s a little slit of a mirror in the coach, right here
by my chair, and I take a peep at myself. Blessings
on Mrs. Christopher, I don’t look like a spinster, and
from Marsville. And then—then I bury my face
in nice Mr. Elliott’s flowers, drinking in their perfume,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
and splashing them with some very big and salty
tears.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>April 25th.</i>
</p>

<p>I have spent the morning in Plymouth’s quaint old
graveyard—such a soft, sunny, springlike morning.
I have looked at the dim old slabs that bear testimony
to the virtue of departed wives. I am sitting on the
grave of a virtuous wife now, looking past the stones,
past the big rock the nimble Pilgrims leaped on when
they landed on free soil, far out to where sea and sky
meet. Had I been a Puritan maid I would have said
to my lover when we climbed to this hill soft days like
this and looked to sea: “Dear boy, with my heart I give
you all that women who are like me give to one man—the
thoughts I have kept for you, the lips I have kept
for you. If you had a great searchlight and should
throw it back over the road of my life there’s not a single
little bend that it would shame me for your eyes to see;
but when I’m dead, don’t put my virtue on a tombstone.”</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>April 26th.</i>
</p>

<p>This has been a heavenly day. Mr. Elliott came to
Boston on business and ran down to Duxbury to see
some friends of his, and all of them motored over to
Plymouth and got me. I lunched at the loveliest
home in Duxbury. The sea was almost in the back
porch. Mr. Elliott came back in the machine with me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
and took the train for Boston. When he left he held
my hands in a mighty close friendly clasp, and he
said—never mind what he said. It is lovely of Mr.
Elliott to be so good to me, and it’s comforting down to
my toes. For some idiotic reason I want to cry again.
I won’t cry! And I won’t sit here. (I have climbed
to the old graveyard, and seated myself on the slab
of a virtuous spouse.) I need all my nerve force. It
must sparkle in the changes I’ve got to put in my book.
And I know why I’m nervous, and I know why I want
to cry. It’s always satisfactory when you can chase an
emotion to its lair——I was taken to the graveyard
when I was very little—mammy used to take me with
her when she went to put flowers on my great-aunt’s
grave, the lady whose false teeth fell into mammy’s
care; and she (mammy) was always so solemn on these
occasions—it was before the day of Christian Science—there
was death then, and hell, and a devil. I feel
quite cheerful since I have analyzed the teary feeling.</p>

</p>

<p>A letter from Dicky forwarded to New York and on
here. It lilts like the song of the happy little wren
that was singing in the big cedar tree at the garden
gate the day I left home.</p>

<p>“Oh, Caroline,” Dicky says, “I want to go out under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the stars to-night at home and bury my face in the
pansies that always riot in your April garden. With
their soft little faces close, close to mine, I want to
tell them a secret. I want to tell it to you, too, Caroline.
But not yet—not yet.”</p>

<p>I go out under the stars, through the quiet streets,
and down to the quiet sea. The night is poignantly
sweet and beautiful. Dicky, little sister, child of my
love, keep your secret. I could not bear to hear it
yet—not yet.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>April 27th.</i>
</p>

<p>A telegram from Bobby. He wants to come to
Plymouth. He has something to tell me. It is Bobby’s
chivalry that makes him feel he should go through
the form of asking me for Dicky. I have wired no.
There’s a little kodak of him that I cut from a magazine
and put in my little silver frame. I can reach out my
hand and touch it here where I sit, and, vaguely, it
comforts me.</p>

<p>I have faced it. I love Bobby. To love—it is to
give. Bobby’s wife must give. The hands that take
into their keeping that precious thing—his genius—what
tender, comprehending hands they must be.
There’ll be times, lots of ’em, when Bobby’s wife will
have to do all the loving for two. There’ll be times
when he will thrust her out, and if she sits whimpering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
on the doorstep that it’s cold out there, heaven help
her—how he’ll hate her. There’ll be times when the
work presses, when he’s distrait—knows she’s there
just as he knows the <a id="tn_86">house furnishings</a> are there, bed
near centre of room, bureau against west wall, light
above——If she gets frightened at the wilted leaves
and jerks his love for her out of his body to look at the
roots too often, then heaven help you, Robert Haralson.</p>

<p>Bobby, Bobby, I’d know at a glance—without a
glance. When you opened the door I’d <em>feel</em>, Bobby.
Sometimes her tired-out man child quivering with his
day’s toil asks mother love of his wife. She’s got to be
counsellor, comforter, friend—comrade with whom to
forget life’s cares. Out of all the world she’s got to be
the one woman that is his <em>need</em>. I am your <em>need</em>!
If disaster stripped you of all that the world has showered
on you, if it reduced you to the hurdy-gurdy man
who grinds his organ under your window—Bobby,
Bobby, would Dicky <em>love</em> the gathering of the pennies?</p>

<span class="p-r15"><i>April 28th.</i></span><br>
<span class="p-r05"><i>Morning.</i></span>
</p>

<p>Bobby wires again: “What are you up to, Caroline,
that you didn’t let me know you were here, that Dicky
didn’t know; that Elliott wasn’t told it was Dicky with
me; that you were so naughty in the Square the other
night as to laugh at my confusion? Little girl with eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
like moonflowers, all right for youse. And mum’s the
word.”</p>

<p>“Her eyes, full and clear, with their white-encircled,
gray irises, are like moonflowers.” That’s what Bobby
says on page 131 about his heroine. And back in one
of his first letters to me, “Please turn to page 131 of the
book and try to think whose eyes I tried to describe.”</p>

<span class="p-r05"><i>Noon.</i></span>
</p>

<p>On the heels of Bobby’s telegram I have this letter
from him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;"><i>To-day, Wednesday.</i></span></p>
<br>
<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Dear Caroline Howard</span>:</p>

<p>Please hurry up and get all the sea air you want, and
go up to Boston and let them show you Milk Street
and the <cite>Youth’s Companion</cite> building (that’s all there
is there). Oh, I forgot the beautiful men. Look
’em over! I’ve seen ’em. They all carry a black
network bag with a MS. play, and Emerson, and two
watercress sandwiches for lunch in it. All right for
youse. Do you know I have an idea that you’ll meet
your fate up there among the <cite>Baked Beans</cite>. I’m told
those Apollo “Belvidears” always take to a girl that’s
both intelligent and good looking. Get that? Well, I
won’t send you a wedding present—so, there!</p>

<p>But, speaking seriously, we’ve had rain here all day.
It’s been cold, too—kind of like late of an evening when
you go down barefoot in the ten-acre medder to drive
the cow home, and your mind is on whippoorwills and
stone bruises and Cherokee roses and hot corn-pone,
and the little girl with the white sunbonnet on the adjoining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
farm that you saw picking cherries in the lane,
and who you (I don’t mean you, I mean me) fondly
imagine is going to come over to your farm some day
and scold you when the cow doesn’t come home, but
who really runs away with a patent churn agent and
winds up by keeping a shooting gallery in South Bend,
Indiana.</p>

<p>Oh, well, what’s the <em>odds</em>?</p>

<p>Hope you are feeling <em>quite well</em> after your long trip
from the soggy south.</p>

<p>Now while you are up “No’th” just turn yo’self a’
loose and have a good time. Down in our country the
old-time opinion is that <cite>Liberty Jams</cite> everything into
a bad shape, but it ain’t so. No—the real and genuine
liberty sets you <em>Free</em>; it doesn’t cramp you or lower
your ideals <em>at All</em>.</p>

<p>A great many wise people have learned that; <em>you see
Them Everywhere in Greater New York</em>. And I think
you would like to bring your cow up here and spend
the remainder of your time. You can live nicely on
<em>fifty cents a week</em>; but a great deal better on <em>half a billion</em>
dollars.</p>

<p>Since I have discovered what a help printed matter is
to me, I simply love to write letters. I know a man who
writes 1,900 letters a day to his <em>Loved One</em>. But don’t
you think he is kind of “crowdin’” the mourners?</p>

<p>Please ma’am write to me some more right away; I
like to hear from you.</p>

<p>P.S. I’ve had a great time chopping up the papers
and building this letter. You’ll excuse my frivolousness,
won’t you?</p>

<p class="p1 right">
<span class="smcap">Bob.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>Bobby, I condone your offense—time spent cutting
up the papers, time worth so many cents per word, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
amuse me. Times spent together when apart, how
close they come.</p>

<p>How the sea flashes, and the blue, blue sky flashes,
too. There’s a boat drifting this way. It looks like a
white-winged gull afloat, a messenger of joy. How the
waves sing, and their swelling song is all about a little
girl in a white sunbonnet picking cherries in the lane. I
remember that day, too, Bobby. It was a picnic. You
climbed the tree and I caught up my dress to catch
the big ripe cherries. When the picnic was over and
we got home my gentle mother scolded over the ruined
dress. She gave it to the washerwoman’s little girl.</p>

<p>How the waves sing, and their shouting song is—Bobby’s
<em>loved one</em>.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>Afternoon.</i>
</p>

<p>The day’s mood has changed. A cold wind blows
in from the sea. If mammy could see me out here on
this deserted stretch of shore in the rain and the spray
that dashes on me from the stormy, inrushing waves
she’d say her prayers in thankfulness that she put the
old storm coat and rubbers in, for I’ve got them on.</p>

<p>How fierce the rush of the waves! Something as
elementally savage as their assault of the shore stirs in
me, writhes in its travail—is born. Bobby is <em>mine</em>.</p>

<p>Dicky, light-hearted, laughing child who would pluck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the flower of love as a baby gathers a posy, forgive
me.</p>

<p>When the day is hot and the road is long, and the
flower of love droops, what then, Dicky?</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>Night.</i>
</p>

<p>I have wired Bobby that I will be in New York Wednesday.
It will take me that long to finish the changes
in the book. I wired him that my train gets in about
five-thirty, and that if he likes I will take dinner with
him.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>April 30th.</i>
</p>

<p>Bobby’s wire reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sure, Mike, I’ll be on hand at 5:30 Wednesday to welcome
you on your retreat from Bosting. And don’t
bother yourself about the train getting in at six or
later, for I’ll be on the job and I’ll be there when you
get there.</p>

<p>I have already ordered the lye hominy and turnip
greens for dinner, and you’ll be properly looked after
by the committee of one when you hit the town.</p>

<p>Hoping these few lines will find you the same, I remain,</p>

<i>May 1st.</i>
</p>

<p>Bobby wasn’t at the train. If he was, we missed
each other. I wasn’t conscious of it on the train, but
now I know I pictured him there at the station, standing
just a little in advance of the mass of people;
vaguely, I think my mind ran the gamut of earth’s
meetings and thought of dim shores, not of earth, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
that one who goes first must surely await the other.
To the whir of the wheels as they ate up the miles that
lie between Boston and New York my heart sang,
Bobby’s loved one, Bobby’s <em>loved one</em>. I was in a
maze of vague, happy thought—and he wasn’t there—he
didn’t meet me.</p>

<p>It is 12 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> now. I went with Miss Jackson to a
horrid little show, and when we came in I could not believe
there was not a message of some sort for me.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>May 2d.</i>
</p>

<p>I stayed in all morning in such a tense state of expectancy
that it has left me limp. How glad I am that
Dicky does not know I am here—I simply can’t see
Dicky yet. I am at sea as to Bobby’s reason for not
meeting me, at sea that no message from him comes to
me, but one thing I know: I can trust his, “Mum’s the
word, Caroline.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Christopher and I shopped this afternoon.
Afterward we had tea at the Astor and went down to
the Waldorf and sat in Peacock Alley. Such a mix up
of fine clothes and commonness. The women have
hard faces, painted, world-weary, they are too much of—oh,
everything: too red as to lips, too black as to
eyebrows, too gold as to hair; they don’t walk—they
can’t, poor things—their general appearance as they
mince along the Avenue is that of a procession of mannikins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
done up in slit bolster cases. Bah! It all makes
me think of a big rock near Marsville. Once I passed
it with a mountaineer. “When I wuz a child,” he
said, “that wuz a monster rock—the masterest (biggest)
rock I ever seed. Hit’s dwindled sence I wuz a
child.” Since I reached here New York’s dwindled.</p>

<p>“Caroline Howard,” I said to myself, sternly, out in
the street again, “it isn’t New York that has dwindled—it
is you. Robert Haralson didn’t meet you. Whatever
his reason for a dime he could have ’phoned from
his home; a slot machine would have cost him a nickel,
a note a two-cent stamp.”</p>

<p>My shoulders braced, my chin went up, my spirit
caught the spirit of this great wonder-town. Night
fell. The magic of night on Broadway—the flashing
signs, the whizzing motors, the hurrying, surging
throngs, the snatches of speech that drift to one’s ears,
there on the street where all seems youth, laughter,
joy—human documents, the snatches of speech one
hears. “How can I leave you here?” I heard the
words spoken by a plain anxious-faced woman, and
the overdressed, under-dressed, doll-faced girl’s answer:
“You poor dear! How you worry! What have
I to fear? New York’s lovely, and my job’s lovely,
and my boss is loveliest of all.”</p>

<p>I heard a man’s voice, such a cultured, hearty sort of
a voice, but a note of bitterness and discouragement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
rang through it. “That man—I gave him his chance—brought
him here. Look where he is now, and look
where I am. He is not an artist. His success is not
based on a solid foundation. But look at him—money—fame—what’s
the use of holding to one’s ideals, of
being faithful to them. What’s the use of—anything?”</p>

<p>My train goes out in an hour. City of laughter and
of tears, of power that can crush as a giant foot crushes
an ant, marvel of the world—I bid you adieu.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<span class="p-r15"><i>May 4th.</i></span><br>
<span class="p-r05"><i>Sunday Night.</i></span>
</p>

<p>I’ve broken the Sabbath by travelling all day. In
town I hired a buggy to bring me home. Our hacks
do not run on Sunday. It is raining. It has rained
all the way. I had a silent driver who never spoke to
me, seldom to his horses. I was glad that it was raining;
glad that my driver was silent. My thoughts were as
vague, as blurred as the dim mountain forms seen
through the rain. We drove through Marsville without
meeting a soul. As we passed the Duckett houses
that forever watch each other like antagonists, I saw
that poor old lady slipping home from doing up his
work; I saw him rocking on his front porch in placid
content. A sudden rage against this man-made world
seized me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>I scrambled in my bag for the little gift to her, leaped
out, and sent the man on home with my baggage.</p>

<p>He greeted me jauntily. He was just sitting there
counting his blessings. He could eat three as hearty
meals a day as he had ever et, and when night come
sleep sound as a mouse in a shuck pen—the Lord had
been good to the old man.</p>

<p>I wasn’t hypocrite enough to take the hand extended.
I wanted to shake the life out of his smiling old body.</p>

<p>“Has he been good to the old lady?” I asked. He
only stared at me. “Do you know you told me you
swam your horse through swollen streams once to get
to a little log church because you knew your congregation
would be waiting for you there? You wanted to
preach that sermon that day that some soul might
be saved that you might never reach again. You said
you didn’t want the devil to get anybody. Do you
remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he quavered, “I remember.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I stormed, “it’s my honest belief that he will
get you. I wonder what the God you have preached
all these years means to do with men like you who are
mean to their wives and cloak their meanness to poor
feeble old women under smooth-sounding texts.”</p>

<p>He stood up, his faded blue eyes flashed, his pallid
lips under the straggly white moustache worked. When
he dropped back in his chair, having uttered no word, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
thought maybe I had killed him. But I did not care.
He would have gone to his Maker with a little preparation
he would otherwise not have had. I stood over
him silent, inexorable.</p>

<p>“She got mad because——”</p>

<p>“Never mind what she got mad about,” I said. “For
fifty-nine years and six months she didn’t get mad.
And she’s not mad now. I saw her slipping out of the
back of your house just a minute ago. She’s been doing
up your night work. You ought to go over there and
get down on your knees—the knees you have worn out
praying the Lord to make you the sort of a man you
have not desired to be—and ask her to forgive you, and
bring her home.”</p>

<p>Some good honest blood left in the old veins crept
up and tinged the pallid, sunken cheeks. And, suddenly,
all my fierceness was gone. I was pleading for the love
that had betrayed them at the end of a lifetime. I had
his old, old hands in mine that looked so young and
strong by contrast, and I was leading him back to their
courtship days, to the time when their one little child
was born and she almost lost her life. Some of the
story I knew from him, and some of it I knew from her.
Before I finished the tears were dropping down his
cheeks. “The old man has some lonely hours,” he said.
Gayly I told him they were over; gayly I pressed my gift
into his hand, and I fairly pushed him into her gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>As I hurried on I suddenly realized that the rain was
over, that the eastern hills were sparkling under a giant
rainbow, and that Ellinor Baxter was rushing toward
me with outstretched hands. Ellinor threw as many
of her pupils as she could on her assistant, and, with the
help of one of the older girls, took my pupils in my
absence.</p>

<p>“How radiant you look!” I said as I kissed her. “I
was afraid you would be all dragged out with the
children.”</p>

<p>“The children,” she said, vaguely, and then flushing
like a rosy girl she plunged into stories of the children’s
good behaviour. She turned and walked homeward with
me. Was it that fleeting brightness in the sky that made
her seem so young and bright and strangely changed?</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>May 15th.</i>
</p>

<p>School closed to-day. Commencement was quite a
triumph. Monday morning I went to work in the
schoolroom, examinations and commencement exercises
on hand. Suddenly the play I had seen with Miss
Jackson and thought so bad came into my mind.
The more I thought of it the better it seemed. I decided
on tableaux, my ideas got from that play. There
were just fourteen days in which to work it out, but the
children hailed it with joy. It was something new;
it was something different. Ellinor’s help was invaluable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
Marsville was delighted with it. Ellinor <em>is</em>
changed. If there was anybody here to love I’d think
she was in love. She was running to angles, and now
she’s got some pretty curves, the gray hairs are quite
hidden by the new way she is doing her lovely, heavy,
red-brown hair, and her soft brown eyes—they are
looking out on the spring world with a new, wistful
expression in them. She smiles so easily and she hums
snatches of tender old songs.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<span class="p-r1"><i>May 22d.</i></span><br>
<i>Midnight.</i>
</p>

<p>This afternoon there was an unfamiliar knock at the
door and I ran down without waiting for mammy. It
was Mr. Elliott. He looked so foreign to the old place,
so New Yorkish standing there, that quite without
warning, in the way I do things, while my lips were
speaking a welcome and he was following me into the
sitting-room, something within me was singing: “How
could I know I should love thee afar, when I did not
love thee anear?” But that something within me was
not singing about Mr. Elliott, although I saw the glad
light in his eyes. My own eyes saw the sun-shot
green May-mist of the trees in Madison Square, the
clock’s big face above the treetops, against the sky’s
soft blue the radiant, triumphant Diana. My ears
heard the roll of wheels on the Avenue, the clang of cars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
on Broadway; my veins felt the beat of the city’s
hurrying, feverish life.</p>

<p>Out under the pines where mammy brought tea and
helped me, with the dignity of a departed day, I still
felt alien to it all. Mr. Elliott praised the beaten biscuit,
and she told him as a mark of special favour the
story of receiving my great aunt’s teeth when she was
dying. I could not seem to belong to the scene—the
big waving pine plumes against the spring sky, the
ancient house drowsing in peace, the soft sweep of the
hills, the <a id="tn_98">mountains</a> against the sky like a string of
sapphires. But when Mr. Elliott said good-bye, when
he caught my hands and poured out a flood of eager
words, “Would I? Could I?” I came back to reality.</p>

<p>Did it mean <em>that</em>, this feel of the city? Could I go
back and live there with Mr. Elliott—dear, charming,
nice Mr. Elliott. For one swift instant I was swept by
his belief in what we together might make of life, and
it seemed so infinitely more than I could make of life
alone. For one swift instant that old terror—the
inevitableness of human change—pierced me like a
sword. Always I have felt a contemptuous sort of
pity for Jane Joyner, who lives near, toothless and untidy
and incapable as she is, with the house running
over with dirty children. Was Jane to be pitied?
Jane whose youth and beauty were not dead but had
passed into another form of life—lived in her children.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Was she out of harmony with life’s great laws? Big
and fierce my heart cried out, “No!” It was I who
was outside of life, not Jane. Her man’s arm went
round her shoulders <a id="tn_99">nights</a> when she stood over the
kitchen stove. Her baby lifted its dirty, loving, laughing
little face to hers as it clutched her knees. Taking
my lonely after-supper walk I had seen them through
the open kitchen door. What had I? A dream that
was bodiless, life emptied of the big, vital things. And
if I sent Mr. Elliott away as I sent the others, the boy
lovers who came over the mountains to tell me what he
is telling me now? What have I left that is more than
I refuse? In the bare, honest moment I faced it. Bleak
and stark in its honesty, the truth faced me. After
work hours when I walk in the twilight and look in
Jane Joyner’s kitchen the thing that comes close to my
heart is a dream without a body—nothing more.</p>

<p>“I thought I was happy until you came along,” Mr.
Elliott was saying. “Then I found out how lonely
my gayety was.”</p>

<p>He is strong and fine, capable of making a woman
happy, and I hold the future of our two lives in my
hands. And then he was drawing me to him. Almost,
his lips touched mine. The quick revolt, the wave of
physical nausea—it was as though an icy, sinister wind
had swooped down on my blooming flowers and shrivelled
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>With a desolate little smile I drew back from him,
an alien standing outside of all that might have been
mine. I bade him good-bye, and to-night, when I
walked by Jane’s kitchen, open to the soft night, I
turned my eyes away, afraid to look in on the sweet
little home scene. In all my life I have never felt so
alone.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>Wednesday Morning.</i>
</p>

<p>Mr. Elliott sent back a wonderful basket of fruit.
It came over on the hack and the whole village is agog
over it. The <a id="tn_100">gossip</a> has disturbed dear old mammy
greatly. She suggests that we still the gossip and
flatter our neighbours by giving a party. Then they
won’t know what to think. I have consented. Mammy
is a woman of action. The party comes off this afternoon.
The house hums with activity.</p>


<p class="p1 right">
<i>Wednesday Afternoon.</i>
</p>

<p>The party has passed into history. I got only the
littlest taste of the contents of that beautiful basket Mr.
Elliott sent me. Everybody was here, and they all
seemed to have such a good time. Even the reconciled
Ducketts tottered over. What a success I seem to be
at reuniting severed hearts. If my book is a failure
I may set up an establishment of the sort—go into a
trance and vision dazzling futures for people. Well,
how do I like the idea? Seven days ago had I put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
question to myself my spirit would have flung back in
bitterness, “Physician, heal thyself.”</p>

<p>For seven nights, no matter which way I willed my
feet to go, they have led me past Jane’s kitchen door.
Alone in the soft spring darkness, in the soft wet darkness
some of the nights, I have faced my life. I have
looked in that open door till the bitterness and the
loneliness have gone out of me. Last night when her
man’s arms went about her as she dished their supper,
when her child’s arms reached up to her, I looked in,
not in bitterness, not in pity of self, not in aching loneliness,
but in love. It is wonderful when you can look
in on untidy Janes at their kitchen tasks and feel close
to their happiness. Life’s supremest gift is hers.
Almost, it was mine. Not a makeshift, not a compromise—life’s
supremest gift. Across sunlit waves a boat
like a white-winged gull set sail for me. Almost, it
reached me. How my heart went out to that white
drifting boat of prophecy! How the waves sang!
Bobby’s <em>loved one</em>. Sunlit waves and flashing white-winged
boat are gone. But the singing soul of those
words shall keep my heart young. It shall be tender
to the young and happy, pitiful to the old and alone,
compassionate to all untouched by love, whether they
scoff in unbelief or whether they would lay down their
lives for love.</p>

<p>Oh, how tired I am! And how heavy the silence is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
here in the bridelike, white loveliness of my May garden!
And how this silence differs from its fall silences!
The silence holds resignation in the fall—this is tense
with expectancy. The snowballs that have come so
late this year are swaying, they seem to be beckoning
to some one, but there is no wind. And the lilies of
the valley, late, too—my flower children delayed their
blooming till I came home—are swaying; they are pouring
out their fragrance—it is poignantly, deliciously
sweet, but I feel no wind.</p>

<p>Something is the matter with this garden and with
me. I am quivering all over as if with intense excitement.
The party has tired me out. Just then, when
John opened the gate, I almost leaped from this bench.</p>

<p>The letters John has brought me are from Mr.
Elliott and Dicky. I open Mr. Elliott’s first—a woman
always opens a man’s letter first. It is a fine, manly
letter, and it ends:</p>

<p>“You said you once knew Bob Haralson. He has
been at death’s door—struck down without a moment’s
warning—appendicitis—a knife quick or death operation.
It was the day you came down from Boston.
I remember date because you came down from Boston.
Haralson is creeping about. I saw him yesterday.”</p>

<p>The lines of mountains dance dizzily. I shut my
eyes—shut out the spring glory, my fingers making a
pressing blackness against my eyeballs. I try to imagine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
the world this spring day with Bobby gone out of it.
Then my heart leaps madly. It is explained—<em>explained</em>.</p>

<p>I can’t sit still, so I climb to the hilltop. I am calmer
in motion. I can see the village from the hilltop. It is
being claimed by the twilight, the soft, slow, lingering
spring twilight. There must be a lot of moisture to
make such a brilliant aftermath. The heavens are so
pink they have tinged the eastern hills. League on
league the cloud waves blush pink as the heart of a seashell.
The whole world glows. My mood catches
the sky’s glowing mood. It is explained. He has been
ill unto death, but he is not dead—he is alive—<em>alive</em>.</p>

<p>Something drops from my belt and I pick it up and
stare at it stupidly. It is Dicky’s little letter. Dicky
will know about Bobby. She will explain their presence
together that night at Mouquin’s.</p>

<p>“Caroline, is your right hand paralyzed that I don’t
hear from you? Do a lot of little tow-headed mountaineers
and a garden that I know is at its loveliest
now mean more to you than I do? I can’t understand
your silence. I am coming home. I am to have my
vacation now, and I am to keep on having it. Somebody’s
with me. He is the secret of the prolonged vacation.
I guess it will be in June. That’s the loveliest
time of all. He will be here only a day or two, three
at the longest, and I hate to think of him at that dinky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
little Marsville hotel. Hotel! Ye gods! Come to
New York and we will show you some hotels. Dearest,
won’t you, won’t you, have him home with us? There
are some such ducks of places to spoon these moonlit
nights in that heavenly rose garden of yours.”</p>

<p>Did I cry out in that sharp pain, or was it some
wounded thing out there in the shadow of the woods?
Steadily I finish the letter. It is to-day—now, at
twilight—when the hack gets in, that Dicky and her
lover are coming. She apologizes that we do not
know earlier, but mammy and I are equal to any emergency.
I do feel sorry for mammy, but I walk on
straight into the sunset glare, leaving mammy to her
fate. That is my only sensation—I am sorry for
mammy. She does love to splurge when company
comes.</p>

<p>Far down the road I see a buggy. It is coming this
way. There are two people in it, but it is too far away
to recognize faces. It is two men. It stops. One
man gets out, the other turns the buggy around and
drives back toward the village. The man who got out
of the buggy walks on in the rose-red haze that wraps
the world. The lilies of the valley that I thrust in my
belt send out a sudden fragrance—it is the trembling
of my body that has shaken them. I stop because
I can’t walk on. I lean against a friendly tree-trunk.</p>

<p>The man comes on, moving slowly, feebly, I see as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
he gets nearer. I think of trivial things, as we do in
crisic moments. Bobby is taller than I thought. The
hat he is wearing adds distinction to one who is already
<a id="tn_105">distingué</a>. The crease in his trousers will be
copied by the young men of Marsville. From somewhere
in me a faint satisfaction stirs that the party
has left me wearing my best new gown, my hair done
in a New York way.</p>

<p>Almost at my side Bobby stops, panting a little. I
speak first. Women always do. I feel sure Eve
opened the conversation when Adam waked from the
sleep that deprived him of a rib and supplied him with a
wife.</p>

<p>“So you have come again—and not alone this time.”
It is not in the least what I meant to say.</p>

<p>“Did you know that I came?” Bobby’s low voice
holds a note of surprise. “How did you know? But I
suppose the boy told you.”</p>

<p>“I was in the garden. I saw you. I know why you
came, and why you left.”</p>

<p>“Why did I leave?”</p>

<p>“You ran from a youthful ideal.”</p>

<p>“Men have done more foolish things,” Bobby’s
answer comes gravely.</p>

<p>“And wiser.” I hate the mocking laughter that
escapes my lips.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you.” His face has grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
whiter; it has changed subtly. “Has Elliott been
here? Is it Elliott?”</p>

<p>I sweetly assure him that Mr. Elliott has been here,
and I manage to leave the impression that he may be
coming again.</p>

<p>This time Bobby’s face goes close to black. With a
mocking little bow he bids me good-bye, turns, goes
down the road. He marches straight ahead. I have
never seen a lion stalk through an African jungle, but
I think of one as I look at him. Where is he going?
Where is Dicky’s lover going? A dumb sort of fright
grips me. I spin down the road to where he marches
breast forward with never a backward look—if a woman
can spin in these narrow-not-made-to-overtake-anybody’s-lover
New York frocks.</p>

<p>“Bobby,” I cry, hard upon him, “stop!”</p>

<p>He turns. Not the Bobby of my letters, not the
Bobby of my dreams, not the Bobby of Washington
Square, a politely impatient-to-be-gone stranger.</p>

<p>Always, it is the unexpected that overtakes me. To
my amazed surprise I wet with salty tears my New York
finery.</p>

<p>“I’m tired, Bobby,” I gasp. “I’ve been having a
party—and I’m not used to having parties. That’s
what makes me such a cat. And, oh, Bobby, you’ll
have to pardon things—Dicky just sprung your coming
on us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Dicky didn’t know that I was coming.” He speaks
slowly, he takes my face in his hands and looks down
at me, a long, deep look. The hard, black look on his
own face has lifted.</p>

<p>As I try to tell him that Dicky didn’t tell me he was
ill, that I have just learned it from Mr. Elliott’s letter,
as I try to tell him what the bright May world would
be to Dicky with him gone out of it, and as I flounder
that I hope they will be heavenly happy, I splash more
tears on my pretty clothes.</p>

<p>Bobby’s face flashes—all that a woman could want
or dream of comes into it.</p>

<p>“Dicky didn’t know I was in the hospital. I went
in under an assumed name. When a fellow’s tied up
with publishers and theatrical people like I am——”
Bobby drops the subject as one that holds no further
interest. “If I had died, would it have spoiled the
May world for you, Caroline?” There is a sharp note
of anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>“Bobby, Bobby!” I cry, wildly. “Don’t ask me!
What have you done with Dicky! Where is Dicky?”</p>

<p>“I am not Dicky’s keeper.” The light glows and
glows in his face. “She’s got one, though, and it was
odd we should all three have left town together. I
smoked like a furnace all the way down as an excuse
to keep away from them. Caroline”—Bobby’s arms
close about me—“I am not Dicky’s—I am yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>Walking home in the twilight that is gray and tender
as a dove’s breast, Bobby tells me that he <em>was</em> afraid
the night he ran away. He says he has tried and tried
not to love me—that men like him should never marry—that
they should live alone on the top of the Flat
Iron. “But it is bigger than I,” he says, gravely. “It
has swept me to your feet.”</p>

<p>“To my heart,” I correct, happily.</p>

<p>The hack lumbers around the curve, descends upon
us. At sight of us Dicky and the strange young man
who sits on the back seat <a id="tn_108">with</a> her—John and Ellinor
are on the middle seat—roar with laughter.</p>

<p>“You sly fox!” Dicky cries. “How did you get
here? We left him on the train, Caroline, and he sent
his regards to you—and he said he was on his way to
Colorado.”</p>

<p>“I am,” Bobby boldly declares. “I stopped by to
see if Caroline would go with me. As to my getting
here first, I live in New York. As rapid transit as is
obtainable, say I.”</p>

<p>Dicky flings herself into my arms. “You owe it all
to me,” she declares. “I found him deadly tiresome.”
She beamed on Bobby. “All his talk was about you.</p>

<p>“You sly fox,” she whirled on him again. “You
didn’t need to have me tell you about Caroline. You
were hearing from her all the time, now, weren’t you?
Why didn’t you tell me, Caroline?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“I—I—I——” I stammered.</p>

<p>Bobby isn’t timid, he’s bold as a lion. “The reason
is obvious,” he declares. “I wouldn’t let her. Had
you known that I heard, too, it would have changed
everything.”</p>

<p>The others descend from the hack. It goes on with
Dicky’s baggage. I realize that John has been an
unnecessarily long time helping Ellinor out of the
carriage; but there are no surprises left in the world.
I greet Dicky’s lover. As we take our leisurely way
home I don’t even wonder what mammy will have for
supper.</p>

<p>I am just back from taking a look at old Camel Back.
The morning’s like an opal—it’s all a shifting mist shot
through with sunshine. None of the mountains have
shaken off their last night’s mist-blankets but that brave
old blessed Camel Back. He knew I’d be up, and he
gave me royal greeting. “Well,” he seemed to say,
“haven’t I poured all the treasures of the earth perfumed
with all the scents of Araby into your outstretched
hands?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>I meant to tell Bobby about Camel Back—for so
long I have told my fancies to a pictured Bobby—but
when I thought of it last night, just before he left
for the “dinky” little hotel with Dicky’s doctor—he
was busy fitting a piece of cardboard in which he
had cut a round hole on a certain finger of my left
hand, and, anyway, it is not easy to tell fancies to an
eager man who is murmuring realities in one’s ears—like
this: “Dearest one, will you hurry, oh, hurry, and
get the gingham, and the barred muslin, and the bias
bombazine fixed up, and let’s get married quick.”</p>

<p>The morning’s at seven. At eight all of us, Bobby
and Dicky’s doctor, Ellinor, too, are going to breakfast
in my rose garden. Mammy planned it last night.
She came to the sitting-room door and asked them all
with the manner of a duchess.</p>

<p>I go to the kitchen door—broiled chickens and
waffles, strawberries and cream. “Can I help you,
mammy?”</p>

<p>“Mammy don’t need no help. This come while
you was gallivantin’ up the lane.” The big, bold,
square envelope sets my heart to leaping:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dearest</span>:
</p>

<p>I looked into my thought reservoir last night after
I left you and discovered that if I hadn’t ever met you
before I would have loved you just the same. Is that
disloyalty to Carrie with the gold braids and the
capricious moods? No, by my halidome, no! I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
two in my heart—two girls—one the ideal of romantic
youth, the other, the completer, sweeter, better beloved
Caroline, but no less an ideal. Am I not the
richest man in the world? If this be bigamy, give me
bigamy or give me death.</p>

<p>P.S. I didn’t answer that question last night.
Why did the cabby swear at you? Cabbies always
swear unless you tip them. But never mind, hereafter
I’ll be on hand to do the tipping for you.</p>

<p>P.P.S. I want you, my honey.</p>

<p>P.P.P.S. I need you.</p>
